What an honor it is to be here.
You to certainly have been an incredible year since our last meeting.
And we've just passed out.
I think notes on the fence of 1st on 5.7.
Those are the notes I use in Bible College.
When I teach on this and day spring Bible College.
It some things in it I'm going to refer to.
Some things we won't get to tonight,
but I just wanted you to have.
Because, and more I thought about there's a specific aspect
of this that I wanted us to hit tonight.
If I was going to put a title on this,
it would probably be no one question mark.
And the reason for that, you hear this all the time.
Folks say no reputable person, no one
thinks 1st John 5.7, belongs in Bible.
Now say no one, really.
Last year when we had our meeting and we addressed the King James
transition movement, the folks who were discussing
how to transition your church away from the King James.
And I addressed that in the last message on Friday night.
And it was getting some attention.
Number folks came, number folks watching.
The next Monday in a college class in what is advertised
as a King James school.
Professor got up in class criticized me for speaking on that.
And dismissed me as someone who could discuss this subject,
because I believe 1st John 5.7, belongs in Bible.
They made a statement that no one who thinks 1st John 5.7,
belongs in a Bible, should be allowed in front of young people.
Because no one thinks it's reputable.
I can't tell you how many times I've heard that over the years.
In fact, as we have been addressing these things,
very, very often folks will try to dismiss everything we want to say
with one sentence and the sentence will be one of these three things.
No one thinks 1st John 5.7 is reputable.
Or after all, King James Gay, or no one can understand the King James Bible.
No, all those things can be and have been answered in a dress.
I, when we first talked about doing this, I was talking with a friend.
He said, look, he said, you know the King.
And today the King James Bible is over whether it should be or not.
It's fading away, you guys can't do anything about it.
He said, I understand, you want to take your stand and he's kind of like an alamo
last attempt, you know, to stand for what you think is true, even though it's doomed to failure.
That's not in my mind.
I intend for us to win this battle.
I have to be completely honest.
At the time, I thought we'd win it in a completely different way than we are now.
At the time, I thought there were a lot of good colleges that took this stand and they just needed
some buttressing and some help to be able to keep everything in front of their students
and that we could work with and help and encourage those colleges and that would be where
the victory would come from.
I'll call that one wrong.
The last 13 years, many of those colleges, especially the larger ones, have moved farther
and farther away from a King James position, even though some of them still claimed to hold
it.
Back to Brown and I, we're in the Cayman Islands, last summer.
And we were doing a King James conference and we were talking after the service and the
pastor son who attends one of these schools, well known as a King James school, these
are thank you men so much, he said that's so very helpful in answering what I'm hearing
for my teachers and his father said that you're in a King James school and he said and
I've heard this line and would connection with these three other colleges, the school
is King James but the professors are not for whatever that means and it's been an interesting
year but I will tell you, even during a period of time, when our historic Bible colleges
often are sliding farther and farther away from this truth and not all of them, just in
case you were interested, the two men that teach on these subjects at Dayspring Bible
College or David Brown and I and there's some other colleges doing good, I had to
probably to teach in class on this at Norse Baptist Bible College this last year but I really
believe the events of the last year says to me that we are winning this battle and let me
illustrate to you why I say this, there have been two things happening, one is there is an army
of young men all over the world beginning to address this on the internet in formats that
young people are listening to more than they're listening to Bible College and they're raising
up this mantle and they're addressing to it, it's all over the place I do about an interview
once a week now, I am the least tech savvy person you know and the least tech interested
person you know, I thought I always thought those things were fads and they'd go away quickly
and it mazes me part of my life in ministry every single day now comes from all this
up to an including today but it's been amazing the impact this army of folks that are addressing
these truths on the internet and one reason they're having to do that is but because our Bible
colleges are not but the impact they're having is utterly amazing and the second thing
reason I believe our movement is winning is because of the impact of King James Bible Research
Council videos on the YouTube on the internet in various formats and I as I travel every week
one or two churches every week doing these interview I hear about the results of our ministry
all the time few examples today and we were have supper break and I ran over to my room and
checking messages and and I saw where preacher I never met pastors in print of after church in Georgia
said something very kind about me in response to someone who's been critical of me
so I I contacted there's well thank you I really appreciate that and we had talking about
a little bit for it never met him didn't know who he was didn't recognize the name found out he
passed and he had been a Baptist church in Georgia and I saw a really appreciate those kind
words I would love to come preach for you sometime and so we already have
he said our wins denied services he said our videos from the King James Bible Research Council
website he said you've already preached to our people a number of times and they love you
say I I first ten years of preacher I was wrong on his whole subject by the grace of God I
began to get a hold of it 41 years ago every now and then someone would ask me to address it I've
taught it in at least three different Bible college settings here in the states and
other foreign countries and and every now and then I would get to speak on this and address it
and that was fine but since we started this thirteen years ago and started posting messages
I can't comprehend the things that have happened and the opportunity to address this
couple weeks ago I was asked to go be interviewed on a TV show in Australia
it can be broadcast live and they sent me instructions what to click on and my computer and all that
kind of thing and I get on there and the guide begins the program mixaers begins the program
by playing the introduction we had to this meeting on internet and any begins to talk to me about
this and what we're doing and people could send messages in while the program is on
and it's being broadcast live in Australia and New Zealand I start getting one message after another
after another from people who are blessed by having watched the videos my programs
we did most of the program simply on the history of this organization how it came about what is
purposes what we're doing I was in Australia I've been Australia twice one time just to do
a conference on the King James another time I preached it on in a couple churches while it was there
and I was in a church and gentlemen came into the service in Australia and he said I'm a
visitor here visiting here in the country but he said I saw this that Phil Stranger was going to be here
he said is this the Phil Stranger from the King James Bible Research Council
yes he said he said I've listened to you folks often we're talking and he told me
he was from the nation of Cook's Island I did not know there was a nation I
live nation of Cook's Island I had to look it up but he had been watching us there
I could go on and on just to make the point I will for a little bit because I want you to get this
we are not on our heels making a last stand defense I believe the biggest enemies of the King
James Bible today are no longer the modernist no longer the Westcott and Horton crowd the biggest
enemies of the King James Bible today are independent Baptist and fundamentalist who think
they have been anointed to be the generation that delivers us from the King James Bible
I didn't fill peas in January go go every January in August
had a preacher called me and he says for the Stranger he said I was I had just taken a
pastor to the church the founding pastor had passed through his 80s and he just passed away and he said
and I have this responsibility of this large church with all these ministries and he said I'm
wanting to identify the basics and and have a good foundation and he said I googled
King James Bible issues and all that he said I kept coming across King James Bible research council
and he said I was talking to one of my friends and I was telling them how much this was helping
me and he said well did you know one of them is in the Philippines right now
he said is there any chance I could get you to come to our church
I so brother I appreciate the invitation this is Wednesday afternoon I said I'm leaving Monday morning
my Sunday scheduled my Saturday scheduled my Friday night scheduled all day Thursday,
Thursday night scheduled they said would you come on Friday afternoon
he said if you'll come on Friday afternoon I'll guarantee you a hundred preachers at our meeting
why said yes but I didn't expect I'd take an American I wasn't really expecting a hundred preachers
hundred and seventy two I'm scheduled to be with him in August he said now this time we'll get you a good crowd
an impact is amazing a cult pastor called and wanted to know if I can come out and
reason he knew about me he was watching our videos if I would come out and do a session for a number
of the preachers and they're called and on the king James and that's how he found him and
knew me because they were looking things up about it said a lot of our guys are interested in this
that are concerned about it I said I wouldn't do you good to have me in your church and when
do me good to be in your church I'll tell you what I do so if you may want to get together we'll have
a separate meeting in a neutral location I will come out and do the best I can to address this later
the cult headquarters would find out about the plan and threatened to decredential any
preacher that came to it we didn't have that I got an invitation to go to Alabama
couple men got a hold of me and they said brother stringer in our town we do not have a single king
James church but so there's a lot of people in our town that are interested in this issue
says if we flew you down would you come give us a Saturday afternoon for the people in our town
that want to hear about this and I kind of knew the answer before I said why me watching your videos
couple years ago I heard from three preachers I'd never heard of before
gentlemen I'll work with brother Anderson and they said we'd like to do an interview with you
one that King James Bible I'd never been to any of their meetings I'd never have
brother Anderson until yesterday I didn't know any of these men were asked well they said we'll
fly out they flew out to the college interviewed my in office and and it is telling that interview
I've heard all over the world from people who've seen that interview I said why me
they've been looking at our videos I could go on and on and on with this I will tell you
to in the combination of those two things and I said folks you know we're winning this battle
let me tell you why we're winning it because most of these battles have been fought with politics
take our position or you'll never get to speak here take our position or we'll blockball you
do it our way or we'll attack you we've been fighting with content from day one and the content
is resonating places you would never have expected had a fellow call me said brother stringer said
I just heard the next month in Indianapolis you're going to be the Sunday
do a session on the King James Bible he said our church needs that so bad I said brother I
appreciated but every Sunday but one is booked for the next year and a half he said would you come
on Saturday for our church so I'm going to be doing all day Saturday session fourth in June
I'm gonna tell you something I'll make a prediction I may not live to see this fulfilled but somebody
write it down 10 years from now I'm 70 that's turned 71 10 years from now the Bible colleges
that would not want anything to do with us today are going to be pretending they were with us all
long because the tide is turning and you folks that support meetings like this are surely a part
in that and I'm grateful for it was interviewed the other day by fellow who has a
program subscribed to YouTube programs subscribed 250,000 my phone has not stopped ringing
and people who heard that interview I'll tell you something amazing is happening
I was on my way to preach to the church in Alabama preacher and schedule me a couple of years
ahead of time he called me about two weeks before he said brother stringer I need to change the whole
theme of our meeting if you're willing I said I'll do what I can he said my church has tripled in
attendance in the last few months has so many united methods churches were leaving the
nomination they said no we're not going to leave it else leave and then made a couple of churches
around here mad and all the people left those churches and they have come to our church he said
they've tripled our attendance more than tripled our offerings but he said I've got all these
people from all of this is brand new to them so he said I once you do a night in this and I
in this night one night on why the king James Bible because all these people have been in the
united methods church need to understand what we're doing this I thought it might be interesting what
their response would be I can't tell you how many of them came up and thanked me they had never heard
this before they felt bad that no one had ever told them this but once they heard it I will tell you
we're winning I hear all over the place from people who are reading brother Daniel's books
David Daniels do you know him? I started going from saying I know him we were together in a
meeting once to thinking I could write on his name I tell everybody's my best friend now
and glory to God I'm gonna say some we're winning I don't know that I said that a year ago
one of the reasons we're winning frankly is some of those books got to be so open and they're
talking about how to transition your church and and so I responded with a message last year
ten ways to transition your church from the king James Bible I said point number one
light of the pulpit committee when you're interviewing to be faster and I went on and people have
got to hold me person after person they had got home to say how did you know how did you know
what happened to our church right after that message somebody came up to me and said I'm from this
is church I'd never heard of it I'd never heard of the town it was in they said who told you
what happened to our church nobody had to but I'm gonna tell you those folks have been doing a
really good job of advertising this issue for us well one and then they all want to have a one-line
answer that they don't have to get into anything and that immediately cancels us and this is one
of them nobody thanks first John five seven blogs in a Bible no reputable person the only people
thank first John five seven blogs in a Bible of people who take their orders from Peter
Reckman I met Peter Reckman once when I was fifteen my only real memory of him is I played
water polo against him and all those stories about how ruffy was playing water polo are true
that was his entire influence of my life I made a decision never play water polo with him again
but no one so real and they just repeat this clear well they know one this is a brand new idea
really no one well let's just take a look John Calvin actually not a big John Calvin fan
but you can't say he had no influence are no notoriety and many of these folks in Calvinist you would
thank his opinion we carry some weight he believed first John five seven blogged in the Bible and included it in his commentary
no one I'd heard for years frantic certain he was the most influential the greatest theologian
whose works had never been translated English I'd heard that several times and then the
announcement was made it's been finally been translated English it's been made available and and so I got a copy
just out of curiosity boy you ought to read your section it's actually in the notes that I gave to you
his comment on first John five seven let's see if we can find it in those notes
let's go to page 83 no body third it may be proved from first John five seven where three are
expressly mentioned who said to be one for these three the for there are three that bear
record have and the father weren't holy ghost these three are one three witnesses are about
forward not as qualities but as persons for as the father's a person saw also the word in spirit
replaced in the same word in degree witnesses not human or angelic who letter divine testimony
are opposed thereby to a human in creed witness and he goes on and makes this point next page
underlined for the most ancient and approved manuscripts which retain the text support our opinion
Jerome and his prolonged remarks that he had existed in the Greek manuscripts and arasmas
confesses that it was extent in the codex botanicus most approved editions complete tendons
antwerp arasmontanus rubber stevens and walton which are found to the palm of the best
manuscripts have it hence if in some it is warning this must be attributed either to the fraud
and treachery of the Aryans as Jerome acknowledges or of the more ancient heretics who separately
just hands evidently tamper with the scriptures he said if there's some manuscript out there they don't
have it it's because the Aryans tampered with them and took it out no one
hey by the way I mean I like John Calvin but his doctrinal book institutes of the Christian
religion are the most significant doctrinal books ever written they've been in print continuously
for 500 years no one turitan how about John Gil is interesting as you're you say they'll say
it's not in one ancient manuscript it's only in one or it's only in two new king James footnote
it's only in six another person listed 11 John Gil hundreds of years ago listed eight
manuscripts that it was in and wrote a three page defense of first John five seven no one
John Gil on see no one here we hear Matthew Henry commentary in print over 300 years
probably the most quoted commentator ever again and again and again you hear Matthew Henry
the three commentaries I read no matter what passage of scripture I'm going to be addressing
one his brother sorensons one is J. Verne McGee's and one is Matthew Henry's
he addressed it and made it clear that in his mind in spite of the controversy the evidence was not strong enough to
remove a passage that had been so significantly accepted for so long by so many no one Matthew Paul
his commentaries have been in print over 300 years introduction to his commentary he talks
about how and we're going back 1700's introduction to his commentary he talks about our new
and improved translation describing the king James and that would be the authority
for his commentaries and he addresses first John five seven absolutely believing even though it's been
left out of some copies he says it's expressed testimony of the triune deity by what's
whoever carelessness or ill-designed left out of some copies but sufficiently demonstrated by many
ancient ones to belong to the sacred text nobody somebody was on me about this one time
say well nobody reputable believes in this okay so apparently I don't side with you I just
with Calvin and turtlene and Gil and Henry and Paul ever hear of any of them
Robert Damne who wrote on it extensively but it was not just those folks tindle Bible,
Matthew's Bible, Tavernard Bible, the Great Bible, the Geneva Bible all included first John five seven
every group of the translators and not just them when the national bibles begin to be produced
is a product of the reformation the German translators the Dutch translators the Spanish translators
the Swedish translators the French translators the Italian translators the Swiss translators
all included first John five seven and you have some guy who's proud of the fact he survived
New Testament Greek with a sea and he is going to correct all of them in his infinite wisdom
when this first begin to be attacked by Westcott Hort there was extensive reaction in the church
of England and book after book after book was produced many of them you can still order
reprints of today I have a number of them book after book was produced as people responded
to the attacks on first John five seven that were coming up as folks addressed them with the
work that Westcott Hort was doing. Number of times reading I would come across mention of Louis
Galson's book The Upalista the Bible is divine origins inspiration and again and again
people would come and say it is the classic the all-time classic on inspiration
and I heard that phrase or saw that phrase many times I felt like someone must have said this
and people picked it up and ran with it and eventually I got a copy of Galson and apparently
these folks had who were describing as the classic had never read him he lived from 1790
1863 he did not take any orders from Peter Reckman his entire ministry was in French
he did not address English at all or the King James Bible at all or ever quote or refer to
the King James Bible but in his book by he deals with the two family of manuscripts as
clear as it could be he addresses the attacks on first John five seven and his book written in
French in the 1800s he answers every attack on first John five seven I have ever read about
no one say no how about Frederick Nolan his inquiry in to the history of the Greek
Vulgate or receive text which he addresses his reasons for trusting first John five seven
no one you know why would these folks say no one credible
well maybe they're ignorant of all these things maybe they're dismissing the Bible that
God has used for 400 years with just a quick one sentence that is a cliche that they have never
studied they just copied from somebody but about the question comes up why did all these people
believe this why were they so convinced well you begin to look at the attacks on first John five seven
and they begin with a fellow and I quote him a historian well known historian Edward Gibbon
and he he expressed this idea that he just never had belonged and that what happened was around the
fourth century he at least wasn't claiming somebody invented it recently they said I'm around the
fourth century somebody put this out and they were heritage you understand they they they believe
Jesus was God and their heritage and and because they were heretics they tried to sneak this into the Bible text
you look at page seventy eight he's writing and he presents this as history
even as scriptures themselves were profane by their ration sacralidious hands
the memorable text which asserts the unity of three who bear witness in heaven is condemned by
the universal silence of the orthodox fathers ancient versions and authentic manuscripts
they said you look orthodox but none of them mentioned it except at many of them do
it's not in any of the ancient versions except the one thing it is and it's not an authentic
manuscript because he calls any manuscript that has it not authentic and then he alleges this he
says he was first alleged by the Catholic bishops when numeric someone to the conference of
Carthage an allegorical interpretation in the form perhaps of a marginal note invaded the text
of the Latin Bibles so he said that's what happened right then someone wrote it in the margin
of a Latin Bible and that's where it came from the Catholics invented it to try and teach the
media Christ these historical reference for that does he tell you how he knows that happened
who sought and reported it who are the witnesses what is the evidence it was just well that must
happen so it must be that way that's not history but folks have been repeating it ever since
they says after the invention of printing the editors of the Greek testament yielded to their own
prejudices or those of the times and the pious fraud which was embraced with equal zeal at
Rome and in Geneva has been infinitely multiplied in every country in every language of modern Europe
he said all these received text Bibles they all know one true but they tried to sneak it in there to make
people believe in the Trinity and the deedive Christ so there it is that's facts it's written in a history
book so must be true amazing how many people code him he makes reference to the council
Carthage 484 to 485 AD primary topic of that council there are many councils of Carthage
but the primary topic of that council was the Trinity and they debated the Trinity for days
weeks months and on one side was the group of 400 preachers who defended the Trinity with first
John 57 on the other side were hundreds of preachers who attacked the doctor in the Trinity
and they didn't say that's not in the Bible you guys just made that up there's no record of any
of them ever challenging whether that was in the Bible or not what they said was it must be interpreted
allegorically rather than literally now some guys have come along to this great debate
and they said man we're in trouble who aren't people to believe in the Trinity
but you know it's not a Bible so we got to make up a verse and sneak that verse in
no one will have ever seen it in a manuscript before but we're gonna write it in the margin
and we're gonna take it to the great debate and they'd gone in and say look at this there's a note
in the margin of our Bible that says there's a Trinity how do you think the debate would have gone
do you think anyone would have hesitated on the other side to say you know that doesn't belong in there
so why are there so many old manuscripts that don't have it in there there are a number
a boy's real simple let me ask you this one why is first John five seven not in the
Jehovah's Witness Bible why did they have to but what would have happened if they had produced
their new world translation and in their new world translation first John five seven the three or
one and a Jehovah's Witness was just sitting there reading his new world translation one day
and he came to first John five seven and he read it what would happen it would destroy his faith
in the Jehovah's Witness cult what would have happened if the Aryans had left first John five
seven in their Bibles one reading would have destroyed what they were doing so what they do
they cut it out but they were 400 preachers willing to sign their name to a statement
that included the quote of that back in the 400s that included the quote of that verse as scripture
and they'd stick their position on it because here is the truth from the beginning until now
there have been two textual traditions concerning first John five seven there have been texts that
left it out and texts that included it somebody was willing to mangle the scriptures to make their
point somebody was either willing to commit the sin of taking away from the scripture
or somebody was willing to commit the sin of adding to the scriptures
try as hard as you want to you can't deny it was there simply encoded in 250 AD
Gregor Nazanius in the 4th century Jerome wrote about it in the introduction to the Latin
Volgate and said the reason and explained it first John five seven is there and then this
reason is there is because but not in some others is because the heretics had cut it out
and scholars say well that's just not true there aren't any real quotations from John
Athanasius quotations not really correct and the fact simply didn't really say that
said those were all fake somebody came along and faked those statements how you know
they have to be fake why they have to be fake because first John five seven is not really in a Bible
how do you know it's not really in a Bible because none of the church fathers quoted
but what about when they do quote it oh those are fake how do you know they're fake
well they have to be because it's not in the Bible
y'all get it there have always been two textual traditions about first John five seven
one of those traditions is the product of fraud either the people who believed in the
deed of Christ who coincidentally turned out to be the people who believe in salvation by faith
and quits it generally turned out to be the people who believe in interpreting scripture
literally were scoundrels willing to mangle the Bible to teach their doctrine
or the people who don't believe in the deed of Christ and don't believe in the Trinity
and believe in salvation by works and don't believe in little interpretation we're willing
to mangle the Bible and I wonder which group we ought to trust
now I know why Westcott or Westcott and Hort hated the first on five seven
Hort called it villainous they both wrote about how this is the time to get rid of it
I know why they didn't like it they didn't believe in deed of Christ of the Trinity
probably the spirits that shared the discussion of translation with Westcott
didn't believe in it either
I understand why the Joves witnesses don't like first John five seven
I understand why given didn't like it
he thought the Catholic Church teaching about the Trinity was horrible
he doesn't even knowledge anybody else and he thought the teaching of the Trinity was horrible
he thought Christianity was a blight on Western culture
so I understand why he didn't like it
but I have a question
why is it that all of a sudden so many independent Baptists don't like it
mean do you think they really studied this and they went through in detail and they analyzed the two textual traditions
and came to the conclusion that this this one that leaves out first on five seven's actually correct
because of their detailed study of the textual debate
most of them didn't even know there was a debate
they just bought it when somebody said nobody believes in this
without asking if nobody believes in how they didn't get here
and how they didn't get in the Spanish Bible and the French Bible and the Italian Bible and the Dutch Bible
couple years ago a Dutch Christian magazine got a hold of me
I was really surprised they said we'd like an article on the history of Christian education
in the United States would you write one for us?
okay they said we'll be responsible for translational
and so I wrote it we sent it to them and they published it they sent me a copy of the magazine
only two words I recognize were Phil and Stranger
I didn't get anything else but then they sent me a note they said we thought this would encourage you
when we translated your article we put all the scriptures in the old Dutch Bible
because we thought that's what you would want
and they added a little note the one that has first John five seven in it
I sent a thank you note back
why so many independent Baptist clinging desperately to the idea
that the anti first John five seven tradition is correct
and some of these folks get interesting I'm talking about all the positive response
I've gotten which is just magnified and magnified over the last year and a half
it's not all positive
one gentleman called me and he was so hysterical I had trouble understanding what he was saying
and I had to ask him slow down repeating himself
what he was saying was it that translation
that translation that translation it's not important
that's the slow down version
so if it's not important what made you feel the need to call someone you've never met
and scream at them over the phone about it
if this is not an important issue I was a special that to you it's really important issue
and I know for a fact it's really important issue to me
I know what the joke is when this is don't like it
I've read the jokes of Smith translation he didn't like it either
I've read the spiritist that translation published by the spiritualist church
that they don't like it either
they get really interesting in first John
first John four one which is try the spirits on our king James Bible in the spiritualist Bible
first John four one says trust the spirits
I understand why they don't like John first John five seven
why does our in a some of our independent Baptist crowd and some of our independent Baptist colleges
why are they so desperate
say this doesn't belong in the Bible
I'm gonna suggest three reasons to you number one they want to look acceptable to the world
and this is the general position of the world and they want to look scholarly
and that's the only question they're asking how does this make me look
secondly
it's the fat of the moment
and they find their fulfillment
and being part of the fad
thirdly their desperate not to have an authority Bible
and ultimately at the end of the whole discussion it comes down to this
do we have a Bible that binds us
or do we have a flexible authority
that might be this or it might be that and maybe it's this this year
but in a different time and a different set of circumstances it could be that
and I repeat what I said last year
that set the gentleman at the college
I said
King James transition crowd recommends we should no longer have one English Bible they recommend five
I had four of the five they recommended
and I didn't want to spend money on the fifth one but I was curious I was at a church preacher on this issue
and a young lady came up to me after the service she said I'm gonna King James Bible
I got to get rid of this one when you take it and it was the one I didn't have
so now I haven't haven't been paid pay penny for it
I said you should use five Bible you should teach your people how to use five
Bibles and everybody should have five Bibles
and I asked the question
of someone what do you do when your Bibles contradict each other
because just within their five Bibles
there's some pretty significant
contradictions for example their five recommended Bibles
one of them the new King James has first John five seven stupid footnote but does have it
the other four don't have it and have even stupid footnotes
so what you believe
the one that has it or the ones that don't
what do you believe when your Bibles contradict each other
and you can't come out say the Bible says you have to come out say the Bibles say
and the answer is just as your pastor
who is the authority in that church who is the authority in that movement
there is not a final authority there is not a soul authority there is not an only authority
the preacher because after all the people have been studying all these things out
the preacher gets to be the authority
when you don't have an authoritative Bible
glory to God having a thwarted Bible
when it tells me what I don't want to hear
it's still the authority
when it tells me to forgive all my enemies
be real honest with you I don't like that
it's not particularly in my heart to do that
I was raised by Kentucky Hillbillies fusting fighting feuding people
I was taught whenever anybody does anything to you you do something worse to them
I was literally raised that way
I mean literally
I get ready for kindergarten and my father explained to me
that most fights are one by the person that throws the first punch
and so you always want to be the person that throws the first punch
okay you had many years later on listening to my wife get my son ready for the first
day of kindergarten and it was you know never getting a fight for any reason if there's a
problem go tell your teacher they man I wouldn't raise that way
my first reaction when I am mistreated
is not to forgive
but turns out I'm not the authority
I have an authority
the authority tells me
that I have to forgive
even when I don't want to
I'm not the authority
honest with you don't like to knock the hell don't like it at all
I didn't say I don't believe it I said I don't like it
if I had created the universe there would not be a hell
but no one should take much comfort in that
because I didn't create the universe
and and the reason I don't like hell
you see I don't like sin but I don't hate it that much
or as much as I should
but the one who created the universe
is a being of perfect righteousness
and he says there's hell
and if I don't like it
I'm not the authority
I mean y'all got it
he's not even a Baptist who desperately want to escape
the concept of an authoritative Bible
and so they just want to have some one sentence
that you can throw out there
King James Bible
it's got for John 570
nobody believes that
no reputable person
no authoritative person believes that
it can't be the word of God
it can't be binding
it's got first John 570
and nobody believes that belongs there
uh number one they're all bunch of folks believe it
long there
I've often said to folks you want to make well I think
you know
I checked that out
with 47 of the finest language scholars that have
ever lived and they all disagree with you
usually they don't know what I just said
what I just said was evoking James Bible
I just read
some people I trust more than I trust you
the desperate attempt
to escape the idea of an authoritative Bible
I believe all the battles were up against
defending the King James Bible
I believe that's the biggest battle of all
and that spirit has gripped
many of our Bible college
another message for another day
has to why and how that happened
but I believe that spirit has gripped many of our Bible colleges
but there is a movement
one I would never predicted
I'm the least tech savvy guy you know
I would never have imagined
if you'd ever told me this was gonna
I just wouldn't have bought it
but there's a movement of people studying
collecting information
getting information for themselves
that are rising to a level that is greater
than many of our Bible colleges
because they start with the premise
God has delivered his word to us
we want to find out where it's at
God bless them
may we do everything humanly possible
to help them God bless you all
you
