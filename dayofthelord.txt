Now if you would turn your Bibles to 1 Thessalonians, 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and what I want to preach about tonight is the day of the Lord.
And we just read about it in Isaiah 13 being prophesied.
And there were some immediate prophecies for the near future that God gave to his eye.
And then there were some that were basically talking about the latter days and the day of the Lord.
And that's what I want to talk about tonight.
But we're going to start our 1 Thessalonians chapter 4.
We're going to study the subject tonight.
Look at 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and verse number 13.
But before we read verse 13, let me explain to you some principles about studying the Bible.
Here's a good rule of thumb for studying the Bible.
If there's something that you're being taught in church, or somebody's trying to teach you something,
and it's something that somebody has to teach you because you wouldn't figuring out from reading it on your own, it's probably not right.
Because, you see, the Bible is a book that's meant to be understood.
God's not trying to deceive. God's not trying to make it difficult.
And so, really the Bible is meant to be understood.
And if somebody has to explain to you some complicated interpretation of the Bible, it's probably not true.
Because if it's not the clear teaching that you can just read and see what it says and understand it,
really with the faith of a child, then it's probably a false doctrine.
There's actually a scientific principle. I forget the name of this principle,
but when you learn about science, and maybe somebody knows what it's called,
but there's a scientific principle that says that when you're studying science and you're looking for an explanation to something,
if one explanation is very simple, and the other one is extremely complicated,
it's usually the simple explanation that's right. Does anybody know what it's called?
Occam's razor.
Occam's razor. Thank you very much.
So that makes sense, because God is not trying to write the Bible in such a way where we need a man to interpret it for us.
The Bible says, you need not that any man teach you, 1 John chapter 2.
He said, but as the same anointing, teach it to you of all things and is truth and is no lie,
and even as it had taught you, you shall abide in him.
You see, the Holy Spirit ought to be our teacher.
90% of what we learn from the Bible should be from our own personal Bible study,
and maybe the other 10% we're getting in church,
because we should be searching the Scripture daily whether these things are so that we're hearing the church,
and not just relying on a man.
But if it's something that has to be taught to you by a man,
kind of like we talked about this morning where the Galatians got into false doctrine,
Paul said, this persuasion cometh not of him that calls you.
Who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?
Somebody came in and taught you this and confused you with all this false doctrine.
You see, the Bible means what it says and it says what it means,
and if you go into it that way and you take it literally, whatever possible,
and just read it for what it says, it's very easy to understand.
Now, let's begin reading this in verse number 13.
The Bible reads in 1 Thessalonians 4, 13,
I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep,
that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope.
Now, here Paul is talking to them about loved ones that have died,
and he says, I don't want you to sorrow like those that have no hope
about those that are asleep in Jesus,
and that's what the Bible refers to as those who died.
They didn't really die because they're alive in heaven,
so he says that they're asleep, their body's sleeping in the grave,
their soul's spirit are alive and well in heaven.
And if you look at the last verse of the chapter in verse 18,
he says, wherefore comfort one another with these words.
So the context of this passage is that they've had saved loved ones
that have gone on to be with the Lord.
They missed their loved ones, they wish they could see them again,
and he explains to them, I don't want you to sorrow like you have no hope.
I want to comfort you with these words about your loved one
that has gone on to be with the Lord.
Here's the comfort that he gives.
He says in verse 14,
for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
even so, them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with them.
So basically the comfort here is that you will see your loved one again.
If they were saved and they are asleep in Jesus,
he says you will see them again.
You don't have to mourn like those who have no hope.
He said, if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
even so, them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with them.
For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord,
that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord,
shall not prevent them which are asleep.
There he brings them up again, those who have gone on to be with the Lord.
He says, for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shell,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God,
and the dead in Christ shall rise first.
Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them
in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air,
so shall we ever be with the Lord,
wherefore comfort one another with these words.
Now you notice there that in verse 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17,
they all mention those who are asleep in Jesus or the dead in Christ.
All of them, every single verse.
That's the subject. That's what he's referring to.
That's the comfort that you're going to see them again.
The comfort is not that somehow this is an escape from any kind of persecution
that you're going to go through in your life or tribulation.
Go back to chapter 3.
It says in chapter 3 verse number, let's see which verse is it, verse 4,
for verily when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation,
even as it came to pass and you know.
So believers have always gone through tribulation.
They've always gone through trials and persecution and troubles
and this is not saying that we're going to escape that.
This is just explaining that when Jesus Christ comes back in the clouds,
the trumpet's going to sound and basically the dead in Christ will rise first,
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds.
This is what's known as the rapture. It's really going to happen.
A real event, Jesus Christ's second coming, is a literal real event that's coming someday.
But let's not stop reading in verse 18.
Let's read chapter 5 verse 1 because the thought is continued.
You see the word at the beginning of verse 1 and chapter 5,
who can tell me what part of speech that word is but?
Conjunction.
That is a conjunction.
A conjunction joins two phrases or two clauses or two sentences together.
And here we have a conjunction which shows that we're not starting a brand new thought.
We're picking up right where we left off and saying,
but of the times and the seasons brethren,
the times and the seasons of what?
Of what we just read about.
Of Jesus Christ coming in the clouds.
Of the trumpet sounding.
See you just have to read the Bible just the way it reads, just for what it says.
He says,
but of the times and the seasons brethren,
ye have no need that I write unto you,
for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief,
in the night.
Now, if we just read this for what it says,
then basically we would equate the day of the Lord with what we just read about.
Right?
Because otherwise he'd say,
well of the times and the seasons brethren,
of Jesus coming in the clouds and the trumpet sounding,
ye have no need that I write unto you,
because of, and he's just going to talk about a totally different event,
because the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night?
Now if that were a totally different event,
would it make any sense for him to say,
because the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night,
ye have no need for me to write unto you the times and the seasons of the rapture?
Obviously the rapture and the day of the Lord are going to happen at the same time,
or else he wouldn't connect them with a conjunction and say,
that's why you don't need me to tell you about the times and the seasons,
because you know that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
Now that's very simple to understand.
Let's keep reading.
He says in verse three,
for when they shall say,
he didn't say when we say or when believers say,
when they shall say peace and safety,
then sudden destruction cometh upon them,
as travail upon a woman with child,
and they shall not escape.
So they are the ones that are going to get all the destruction and travel,
not us, they are.
But watch what he says next,
but ye, brethren, are not in darkness,
that that day should overtake you as a thief.
So Jesus is not coming as a thief in the night if you're a believer.
It will not catch you off guard.
You will not be surprised.
The unbeliever will be surprised,
because they're going to say peace and safety,
and then sudden destruction cometh upon them,
as travail upon a woman with child,
whether or not in darkness,
that that day should overtake you as a thief.
We are all the children of light,
and the children of the day.
He said, we are not of the night nor of darkness,
therefore let us not sleep as do others,
but let us watch and be sober.
For they that sleep sleep in the night,
and they that be drunken are drunken in the night,
but let us who are of the day be sober,
putting on the breastplate of faith and love
and helmet the hope of salvation,
for God hath not appointed us to wrath,
but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.
Very simple to understand this passage, right?
The trumpet's going to sound,
Jesus Christ comes in the clouds,
that is known as the day of the Lord,
and the same day sudden destruction comes upon those
who are not saved, who are not believers.
So basically God pours out his wrath,
the same day that Jesus Christ comes in the clouds
and removes us in the rapture, up in the clouds.
Go back to Isaiah 13,
because you see the day of the Lord is a subject
that's mentioned throughout the Bible many, many times.
The Old Testament is filled with references to the day of the Lord,
the book of Isaiah especially.
This is one of my favorites,
but it's all throughout the Bible,
and when we went through Isaiah week by week,
we saw many, many different times,
but look at Isaiah 13 and look at verse 9.
The Bible says, behold the day of the Lord,
cometh cruel, both with wrath,
you notice God's wrath mentioned,
and fierce anger to lay the land desolate
and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
Watch verse 10,
for the stars of heaven and the consolations thereof
shall not give their light,
the sun shall be darkened in his going forth
and the moon shall not cause her light to shine,
and I will punish the world for their evil
and the wicked for their iniquity,
and I will cause the arrogance of the prophecies
and I will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.
So notice that when the day of the Lord comes
and God's wrath and destruction comes,
notice he said the sun and the moon will be darkened,
the stars will not give their light,
and then he says in verse number 13,
therefore I will shake the heavens
and the earth shall remove out of her place
in the wrath of the Lord of hosts
and in the day of his fierce anger.
Look at Joel, short book toward the end of the Old Testament,
the book of Joel, one of the minor prophets,
Ezekiel, Daniel are big books that you're familiar with
and there's some of the smart books,
Hosea, Joel.
So just a few books after Daniel.
Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel.
Look at Joel chapter 2.
Joel chapter number 2
and you'll see the exact same thing taught.
The Bible is very consistent.
It says in verse number 30,
and I will show wonders in the heavens
and in the earth,
blood and fire and pillars of smoke,
the sun shall be turned into darkness
and the moon into blood
before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.
Now that's pretty clear, isn't it?
Before the great and terrible day of the Lord come,
the sun will be turned into darkness and the moon into blood.
And watch the next verse,
and it shall come to pass
and the day of the Lord shall call
and the name of the Lord shall be delivered.
For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem
shall be deliverance as the Lord has said
and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.
So notice that the day of the Lord is associated
with the sun and moon being darkened first,
then the day of the Lord comes
and then there's deliverance for those who've called upon the name of the Lord.
Look if you would at Matthew 24,
Matthew chapter 24.
First book in the New Testament,
Matthew, Matthew 24.
Look at what the Bible is.
Look at Matthew 24.
You see, the day of the Lord is always associated
with the sun and moon being darkened.
Look at Matthew 24, 29.
The Bible reads
immediately after
the tribulation of those days.
Now, can somebody tell me,
is there anything hard to understand
about the phrase that I just read?
It's pretty simple, isn't it?
Immediately after.
That means right after.
Does it mean during?
No, it says immediately after the tribulation of those days.
The sun shall the sun be darkened
and the moon shall not give her light.
Does this sound familiar?
And the stars shall fall from heaven
and the powers of the heaven shall be shaken.
And then shall appear the sign
of the Son of Man in heaven
and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn
and they shall see the Son of Man
coming in the clouds.
Does that sound familiar?
With power and great glory
and he shall send his angels
with a great sound of trumpet.
You remember the sound of the trumpet?
He says, and they shall gather together
his elect from the four winds
from one end of heaven to the other.
Now learn a parable of the fig tree.
Remember the stars of heaven would fall to the earth
like figs from a fig tree?
He said, when his branches yet tender
and put forth leaves, you know that summer is not.
So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things,
know that it is near
even at the doors.
You see, we are not in darkness
that that day should overtake us as a thief.
When we see these things come to pass
we'll know that it's near even at the doors.
He says, verily I say unto you
this generation shall not pass
till all these things be fulfilled.
He's explaining that at the beginning of the chapter
he starts to describe the tribulation
and the brother
delivering up the brother to death
and all the false Christ
saying, I'm Jesus Christ.
He said, it's all going to happen
in one generation, is what he's saying.
He's not saying that the people he's talking to
would not pass. He's saying from the time
that these things begin to come to pass
that generation will not pass.
A lot of people teach that the events of Revelation
took place over the course of a thousand years
during the Middle Ages
so that it's some ongoing thing
throughout the history of the world.
No. He said this is happening in one generation.
This is a short term thing
but it happened when these things begin to come to pass
he said, it's coming.
Jesus Christ is coming
and you'll see these things come to pass.
He says in verse number 35
heaven and earth shall pass away
but my words shall not pass away
but of that day and hour
knoweth no man
of what day and hour?
Of Jesus coming in the clouds
of the day of the Lord.
He said, knoweth no man
know not the angels of heaven
but as the days of Noe were
so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be
for as the days of Noe
they were before the flood
they were eating and drinking
marrying and giving and marriage
until the day that Noe entered into the ark
basically that's your peace and safety
they think everything's fine
He says, and knew not until the flood came
and took them all away
so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be
then shall two be in the field
the one shall be taken and the other left
watch therefore
for you know not what hour
your Lord doth come
you don't know the day or the hour
but you do know the times and the seasons
because when you begin to see these things come to pass
you'll know that it is nigh even at the doors
you see many people
will try to twist the Bible
now be logical my friend
if you start reading the Bible
and you start to read the New Testament
what's the first book you're probably going to read
when you start reading the New Testament
the book of Matthew
now when I was 12 years old
I decided that I wanted to read
the whole New Testament when I was 12
and I picked up the New Testament
I started reading the book of Matthew
and I got to Matthew 24
and I read it as a 12 year old boy
and I said you know what
I always thought that that was wrong
what they taught me at Christian school and in church
that Jesus could come at any moment
everybody's going to disappear
nobody's going to know what happened
and I said you know I knew that wasn't right
something didn't set well with me
and I read this and I said it's not true
it says after the tribulation
it says the sun and moon are going to be darkened
and I don't think people are going to be wondering
what happened
because the sun and moon were darkened
and they saw Jesus coming in the clouds
they'll know what happened
they won't be saying where is everybody
they'll be saying to the mountains and rocks
fall on us and hide us from the face of the lamb
or from the face of him that says I'm thrown
for the great day of his wrath is coming
and he shall be able to stand
that's what they're going to be saying
but you see we've been deceived
and this is the first chapter you read
as you read in the New Testament
that goes into the Second Coming
it goes into the Rapture
now many people will say well Pastor Anderson
you need to realize
that Matthew 24 is talking to the Jews
that's what they'll say
now first of all I believe that every promise in the book
is mine every chapter every verse every line
I don't know what Jews this is written to
unbelieving Jews
or saved Christians
because I thought that in Christ
there's neither Jew nor Gentile
so I didn't know that that was a big deal
but they say it's talking to the Jews
well flip over if you would have Revelation chapter 6
keep your finger there
look at Revelation chapter 6
you see you've got to just learn
how to read the Bible and just read it for yourself
and not let people twist it around on you
you know I mean if it's clear
it's clear
look at Revelation chapter 6
and the Bible goes through this
it says in verse 1
and I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals
and I heard as the word the noise of thunder
one of the four beasts saying come and see
and I saw the hold a white horse
and he had sat on him out of bow
and a crown was given to him and he went forth conquering
and to conquer
and when he'd opened the second seal
I heard the second beast say come and see
and there went out another horse that was red
and that they should kill one another
and there was given unto him a great sword
so when the first horseman comes
you have a man riding on a white horse
he has a bow in his hand and a crown upon his head
and he goes forth conquering and to conquer
as the antichrist, the imposter
of Jesus Christ, Jesus will come on a white horse
this man comes on a white horse to conquer the world
the second horse comes out
and there's all kinds of warfare
and it's based on the world war 3
you know men are killing each other
there's no peace in the earth
the third seal is in verse 5
and when he'd opened the third seal
I heard the third beast say come and see
and I'd be held in low black horse
and he'd sat on him out of a pair of balances in his hand
and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say
a measure of wheat for a penny
and three measures of barley for a penny
and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine
you see three measures of barley for a penny
or a measure of wheat for a penny
what you have to understand is that
in the Bible the penny is not our penny today
you know
the penny in the Bible
is a monetary unit
that we see in Matthew chapter 22
Jesus tells a parable about people working
a 12 hour day
and receiving a penny at the end of it
and that was a day's wages
and it was considered a legitimate wage
so today if you went to this place down here
that's like a day laborer place
right here because that's basically what the story was about
and Jesus
is telling a story about a man who hires
some day laborers
and today he pays them a penny
and they were happy with it until they saw
someone else that they felt like was getting a better deal
and so how much would you get
if you went and signed up over here as a day laborer
you know what
50 bucks, 100 bucks, 150 bucks
somewhere on there do you want to pay 100 bucks
for a measure of wheat
think about that now
100 bucks for a measure of wheat
or three measures of barley
that's pretty expensive
this is famine being described here
food is in short supply
and supply and demand has caused food prices
to be extremely expensive
so this is a time of wars
famine
conquest
look at the fourth seal
it says in verse number
7 and when he had opened the fourth seal
I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see
and I looked at the old pale horse
and his name that sat on him was death
and hell followed with him
and power was given under them over the fourth part of the earth
to kill with sword
and with hunger
we've already really seen that in the last two seals
and with death and with the beasts of the earth
and when he had opened the fifth seal
I saw under the altar the souls
now notice he's not seeing their bodies
he saw their souls
because the moment that the believer dies
his body goes to the grave
we bury the body
we see the body if it's an open casket funeral
the soul goes to heaven
later the body will be resurrected
at the first resurrection also known as the rapture
so he saw the souls
that were slain for the word of god
and for the testimony in which they held
and they cried with a loud voice
saying how long oh lord holy and true
does thou not judge
and avenge our blood on them that dwell in the earth
and white robes were given
unto every one of them
and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for
a little season
so it's coming retribution is coming
until their fellow servants
also and their brethren
that should be killed as they were
should be fulfilled
and I beheld when he'd opened the sixth seal
and lo there was a great earthquake
so far we had wars, famines
and Christians being killed
and slain with the sword for their faith
he says when he'd opened the sixth seal
and behold there was a great earthquake
and the sun became black
as sack off a pair does that sound familiar
and the moon became his blood
the exact wording of Isaiah 13
and the stars of heaven fell on the earth
even as a fig tree
cast at their untimely figs
when she is shaken of the mighty wind
and the heaven departed as a scroll
when it is rolled together
that's straight out of Isaiah 13
he said at every mountain and island
were moved out of their places
and the kings of the earth and the great men
and the rich men and the chief captains
and the mighty men and every bond men
and every free men hid themselves
and the dens and the rocks and the mountains
from the face of him that sit upon the throne
and from the wrath of the Lamb
for the great day of his wrath
notice the next two words
is come
see the present tense there
is come
if it said has come
like all modern Bibles change it to
the NIV change it to has come
I believe even the new King James change
I'll have to look it up
but if it said has come
you could say well that was a while back
but if you said the great day of the wrath
is come it means it just came
it means it's here now
it has just arrived
I'm going to look it up in the new King James
because the new King James changes so many things
I'd be surprised if it's not changed
let me take a quick look here
yeah here we go
for the great day of his wrath has come
to make it a little easier for you to understand
as always
and so it's very clear in the Bible
that the great day of the wrath is come
that's why they're talking about it right now
the day of his wrath is come
you see God's wrath
comes not until
after the sixth seal
is opened and the sun and moon are dirty
that means that God's wrath did not come
previously
the souls that were under the altar
at the fifth seal were
waiting saying
when will God avenge
our blood on them that dwell here
which means he wasn't already doing it
I'm not going to say
I'm already doing it
can't you see what I'm doing
think about it
I mean just use logic
they're saying when are you going to pay these people back
God which means that it hadn't happened yet
and he said you need to wait
a little season
and then it's going to happen
then the sixth seal is open to sun and moon or dark
that's when he started hiding in the rocks
saying the great day of his wrath has come
and you shall be able to say
verse 1
see you have to understand
the chapter divisions in the Bible make it very easy
to navigate the Bible
and to help punctuate the Bible
but you can't just stop reading
because the chapter is over
well that's it
the Bible flows into the next chapter
in many cases what's the first word of chapter 7
what part of speech?
that's a conjunction
and after these things
I saw four angels
holding the four corners of the earth
holding the four winds of the earth
that the winds should not blow on the earth
nor on the sea nor on any tree
and I saw another angel ascending from the east
having the seal of the living God
and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels
to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea
saying hurt not the earth
neither the sea nor the trees
till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads
so it's clear
that the earth and the sea have not been harmed
by God's angels yet
right? he said don't do it yet
therefore God has not been
pouring out his wrath on the earth
as far as turning water into blood
he said hurt not the sea yet
hurt not the trees yet
there haven't been any locus
there haven't been any plagues from God
he said until we've sealed the servants of our God
in their forehead
and I heard the number of them which were sealed
and there were sealed 144,000
of all the tribes of the children of Israel
then he goes through the tribes
of Benjamin
now these 144,000 Jews
that are sealed
are followed by something else that's mentioned in verse 9
after this I beheld
and lo a great multitude
which no man could number
of all nations
and kindreds and people and tongues
stood before the throne and before the Lamb
clothed with white robes
and palms in their hands
and cried with a loud voice saying
salvation to our God
and unto the Lamb
and all the angels stood round about the throne
and about the elders in the four beasts
and fell before the throne in their face and worshiped God
saying amen
blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving
and honor and power and might be unto our God
forever and ever amen
and one of the elders answered saying
what are these which are arrayed in white robes
and whence came they
now the word whence
who knows what the word whence means
from where
wither means to where
thanks means from there
thither means to there
these are just old words in English
we don't use them much anymore
but when it says whence came they
he's saying where did they come from
now this multitude
it says in verse number
9 it says
after this I beheld and lo a great multitude
and then a guy says
where did they come from
okay it's clear that they just got there
that's why he's saying where did these people come from
okay
they just derived which makes sense
because the sun and moon were just darken
jesus christ was seen by the nation
of the earth they cried out
the great day of his wrath has come
heard not the earth know the trees
the servants of God are sealed
these special 144,000
then all of a sudden a great multitude appears in heaven
okay that's the rapture
that's why it was what no man could number
because the bible numbers multitudes up to
102,000,000
10,000 times 10,000
and thousands of thousands that's 102,000
this is a pretty big crowd if no man could number
and it's of all kindreds
all nations all people
all tongues
this is a big group because it's every believer
who's ever lived okay
and it says here
what are these which are raiden whiteworms
and whence came they and I said to him
sir thou knowest
hey you tell me
he said to me
that's right I was just kidding I do know there
these are they which came out of great tribulation
and have washed their robes
and made them white in the blood
of the lamb
therefore are they before the throne of God
and serve him day and night in his temple
and he that sitteth on the throne should dwell among them
they shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more
neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat
for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne
shall feed them and shall lead them
and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
chapter eight begins with the word
and
when he had opened the seventh seal
so we see a chronology here from the sixth seal
to the seventh seal
and when he had opened the seventh seal
there was silence in heaven about the space
of half an hour interesting that God gives us that time
just a half hour
same day
just a half hour
he says and I saw the seven angels
which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets
and another angel came and stood at the altar
having a golden censor
and there was given unto him much incense
that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints
upon the golden altar which was before the throne
and the smoke of the incense which came
with the prayers of the saints ascended up
before God out of the angels hand
and the angel took the censor and filled it
with fire of the altar
and cast it into the earth
so this is fire raining down from heaven
and the seven angels which had the seven
and there were voices and thunderings
the lightnings and an earthquake
and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets
prepared themselves to sound
the first angel sounded there followed hail
and fire mingled with blood
and they were cast upon the earth
and the third part of the trees was burnt up
and all green grass was burnt up
there's your hurting of the trees
look at the second trumpet
it says and the second angel sounded
and as it were a great mountain burning with fire
now the word as it were
is important here
whenever the bible says
as it were
we would say in our modern vernacular
as if it were
it's basically using a metaphor
it's not a literal mountain
that was thrown in
it says it was as it were
a mountain burning with fire
just so that you know the term there
he said as it were a great mountain
burning with fire
was cast into the sea
there's your hurting of the sea mentioned
and the third part of the sea
became blood so one third of the sea
becomes blood and the third part of the creatures
which were in the sea and had life died
and the third part of the ships were destroyed
the third angel sounds
the fresh water is poisoned and becomes warm
would I'll just blow through it for a second time
the fourth angel sounds the sun and moon
and stars are smitten
and they're only shining at certain times
in the day
but look at verse 13 and I beheld and heard an angel
flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice
woe, woe, woe
to the inhabitants of the earth
by reason of the other voices
of the trumpet of the three angels
which are yet to sound
and then the last three trumpets are even worse
much worse than the first four
it just gets worse
I mean God is pouring out his wrath
in an extreme way
you see the Bible is very clear
turn back if you would now because we saw here
in Revelation 6
we saw the life, the famines, the wars
the pestilence, the beast of the earth
the anti-Christ
people being slain for the word of God
we saw all that
then we saw the trumpet sound
the sun and moon darken
and all these different things
a multitude appears in heaven
same day half hour goes by
God pours out his wrath
go back to Matthew 24 if you would
with that in mind
now remember our dispensational Zionist friends
talking to the Jews in Matthew 24
why don't we just humor them for a minute
I know it's silly
I know it's ridiculous
I know it doesn't make any sense to say
that it's talking to Jerry Seinfeld and Jeff Goldblum
and Richard Dryfus and all these other Jews
that don't believe in Christ
or even if it's talking about Jews that believe in Christ
let's humor them shall we
and say it's talking about the Jews
okay
does that really change the fact
that in verse 29 look at Matthew 24
what are our dispensational glasses on
our Zionism
Jew worshipping glasses for a second
let's put those on for a minute
and let's read it
verse 29
immediately after the tribulation of those days
shall the sun be darken and the moon should not give her light
and the stars shall fall from heaven
and the powers of heaven shall be shaken
no matter who this is talking to my friend
even if it's talking to the Jews
it doesn't change the fact that the sun and moon
aren't darkened until after the tribulation
and it doesn't change the fact that God's wrath
is not poured out until after
the sun and moon are darkened
in Revelation 6-7-8
and so whether or not it's talking
to the Jews or the Gentiles
or whoever they're trying to say
it doesn't change the fact that God's wrath
does not come until after the tribulation
and yet they try to mix
the two
and say well believers won't go through the tribulation
because God wouldn't pour out his wrath on his own people
wait a minute folks
it doesn't matter how you read this
you can't change the fact
that the sun and moon are darkened
after the tribulation
and that the sun and moon are darkened
before God pours out his wrath
because he says hurting off the earth
neither the trees
when the sun and moon are darkened
they say the great day of his wrath is come
and who shall be able to stand
doesn't change a thing
it's the same thing flip over to Luke 17
Luke chapter 17
that's the first chapter you're going to come to
that really goes into in detail
the second coming of Jesus Christ
you find that in Matthew 24
but if you wanted to find the first time
that Jesus mentions
the second coming
chronologically
it would be Luke 17
even though Luke 17 comes later in your Bible reading
Luke 17 is before
Matthew 24 chronologically
because Luke 17
is before Luke 21
and Luke 21 matches up with Matthew 24
in the timeline of Jesus' ministry on the circle
so Luke 17 is the first time
he pretty much introduces this concept
to his disciples this report in the Bible
it says in verse number
22
and he said to his disciples
the days will come when you shall see
when you shall desire to see one of the days of the sun of man
and you shall not see it
and they shall say to you
see here or see there
go not after them nor follow them
but lighten it out of the one part under heaven
shineth under the other part
I'm sorry
shineth under the other part under heaven
so shall also the sun of man be in his
day
this is the day of Christ
also known as the day of the Lord
he says so shall the sun of man be in his day
but first must he suffer many things
and be rejected of this generation
and as it was in the days of Noe
so shall it be also in the days of the sun of man
they did eat
they drank
they married wives
they were given in marriage until the day
that Noe entered into the ark
and the flood came and destroyed them all
likewise also as it was in the days of
Lot they did eat
they drank
they bought
they sold their plants and they built it
but the same day
watch this now
the same day that Lot
went out of Sodom
Lot left Sodom
the same day
fire and brimstone were poured out
on the city
the same day that the angels of God
come and receive us out of this earth
the same day fire and brimstone
will come down from heaven
that's what it says
you see many people will say well
it'll be like it was in the days of Lot
that means everybody will be a homosexual
because everybody in Sodom was pretty much a homo
but that's not what he said
it's gonna be like the days of Lot
in the sense that
just as
God pulled his people out
right before fire and brimstone rained down from heaven
the same thing will happen in the day of
coming of the Son of Man
half hour later fire and brimstone from heaven
just like Noah
Noah got into the ark
the same day that it began to rain
it rained judgment from God
first in the form of water
God promised he would never destroy the earth by water
next time it will be by fire
it's gonna work
but he made that promise
he just didn't want to get worried
every time it starts raining
here we go again what we do now
so
basically gave that the sign of the rainbow
which basically is amazing how the most
wicked and ungodly and filthy people in this world
use the rainbow as their symbol
because I guess it's the symbol
God's not gonna destroy us again
he'll destroy you my friend
it's gonna be with fire and brimstone from heaven
but he's just like he did with Sodom and Gomorrah
you see the Bible
is teaching it
and by the way in Isaiah 13
did you notice that the day of the Lord was compared to Sodom and Gomorrah
read it again
and in your own time I can turn back
when I read it at the beginning of the service
he said it's gonna be like when God
overthrew Sodom and fire and brimstone
that's what the day of the Lord is gonna be like
it's gonna have similarities with that
because he will be raining fire and brimstone
you see the Bible and then keep reading down here
this is a great passage
it says
in that day he which shall be upon the
house top and his stuff in the house let him
not come down to take it away
and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back
remember Lot's wife
whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it
and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it
I tell you in that night there shall be
two men in one bed
the one shall be taken and the other shall be left
two women shall be grinding again
and the other left
does it sound like the rapture is just me
two men shall be in the field
the one shall be taken and the other left
and they answered and said to him where Lord
and he said to them where sort of the body is
that there will the eagles be gathered together
you see notice how he said in that day
and then a few verses later he said in that night
he said how can it be happening
both the day and night
because the earth is round
and there are time zones
and so when Jesus Christ returns
it will be in the daytime
some place people will be grinding in the middle
it will be in the daytime
other places in the world it will be a night
they will be lying in bed
the one will be taken and the other left
and so it is interesting that the bible foresaw that
you know back when a lot of people thought the world was flat
God sees here that it can be day and night at the same time
in different parts and it will be
it must need to be day and night
in different places when any event happens
and so that is in Luke 17
flip over to Mark 13 if you would
you see
the four gospels
I believe are the heart and soul of the bible
now all scripture
is given by inspiration of God
and is profitable for doctrine
for reproof, for correction, for instruction
righteousness that the man of God may be perfect
really furnished unto all good works
but let me tell you something
everything before the four gospels is really pointing toward
Jesus Christ and everything after
is kind of looking back toward Jesus Christ
really the crux of the bible is Jesus Christ
the death, burial and resurrection
that is really the whole message
and really the four gospels
I feel and this is just my personal opinion
are the meat and potatoes of the bible
it is my favorite part of the bible
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
I mean that is where it is at right there
I believe and I just see
all these teachings in the four gospels
of Jesus Christ
on the second coming and it is just so clear
it seems like he just laid it out
I mean he is Jesus you know he is preaching it
he is laying it out for his disciples
for those that are on the serif
and that is why I think it is silly
to just ignore the four gospels
when there is so many references to the second coming
and they re-revelation
and a commentary
re-revelation in the four gospels
that should be your commentary
let Jesus be your commentator for the book of Revelation
look at Mark 13
it says in Mark chapter 13
we are not going to read the whole thing
just for sake of time
but he says in verse 19
for in those days shall be
affliction
such as was not from the beginning
of the creation which God created
under this time not shall be
remember Matthew said the exact same statement
except instead of the word affliction he used
the word tribulation
it says in except that the Lord
had shortened those days
no flesh should be saved
but for the elect's sake whom he has chosen
he has shortened the days
and then if any man shall say to you
lo here is Christ or lo he is there
believe it or not
for false Christ and false prophets shall rise
and shall show signs and wonders
to seduce if it were possible
even the elect
so is it possible to seduce the elect
no
said if it were possible they would
because they are so smooth but they can't
but take ye heed
behold I have foretold you all things
but in those days after that tribulation
the sun
shall be darkened and the moon
shall not give her light and the stars
of heaven shall fall and the powers
that are in heaven shall be shaken
and then shall they see the son of man
coming in the clouds with great power
and glory and then shall he send his angels
and shall gather together his elect
from the forewinds from the
uttermost part of the earth
to the uttermost part of heaven
now learn a parable of the fig tree
when his branch
is yet tender and put it forth leaves
you know that summer is near
so ye in like manner when ye shall see
these things
when you shall see these things
the sun and moon being darkened is what he's talking about
he says
know that it is nigh even at the doors
verily I say unto you that this generation
shall not pass till all these things be done
heaven and earth shall pass away
but my word shall not pass away
but of that day and that hour
knoweth no man
the angels which are in heaven
neither the son but the father
take ye heed watch and pray
for ye know not when the time is
now
is it accurate to stand up and say
the rapture comes before
the tribulation
now in fact it's a direct contradiction
of the Bible
pre-tribulation rapture
no
the imminent return of Christ
he could come at any moment
he could come before the servant is even over
and in fact
we're going to pass the plane again
because you don't need your money
you don't need your house payment
you don't need to pay the car payment
he's coming
put your hand on the screen
if you'll donate
$777
God bless you
look you cannot come by the end of this service
because first there's going to be tribulation
unlike the world has ever seen
then people will be killed for the cause of Christ
and except those days should be shortened
there should no flesh be saved
but for the elect saved those days shall be shortened
if the devil's plan
the mystery of iniquity
the antichrist and the dragon
were able to carry out their plans
and just keep going with it
eventually all Christians would be killed
he's what he said
but he said for the elect saved those days shall be shortened
and he'd endure it to the end
and by 13 he'd endure it
unto the end shall be saved
if you can endure that tribulation
and by the way he said there's no flesh be saved
it's not like you're saved like
I got saved
he's talking to people that are already saved
saying if you're endured at the end of the tribulation
you'll be delivered
you'll be saved by the rapture
when Jesus Christ comes
and rescues you out of this
and then pours out his wrath
and puts down all these things
and all these stars of darkness
and begins to avenge
the blood of those who died for Christ
and those who've been punished
and persecuted by unbelievers
you see it's not accurate to say
the rapture comes before the tribulation
now is this accurate
mid-tribulation rapture
I mean is that accurate
and people always say to me you're mid-trip
no
it's not
it didn't say in the middle of the tribulation
after the tribulation of those days
say it would be
after
after
after
it's after
not before, not during, it's after
but you say oh
people say this
why would Jesus
come down in the clouds
for the rapture
and they call it the yo-yo effect
I've heard people say this
they said why don't we go up in the clouds
and come right back down on white horses
we're not going to come down on white horses until chapter 19
years will go by
you say well how do you know that God's wrath
will take years to carry out
because when the first trumpet sounds
all the grass is burned up
later on you'll see the grass
has regrown
all you have to do is just read the Bible
Rebellation 8 and 9
get in chapter 9 there's grass again
because it's going on over the course of years
the one trumpet alone
of the plague of the locust
takes five months
so we have a time frame going on
so there's no yo-yo and by the way
last time I played with the yo-yo
I didn't throw it up and then it came back down
usually with the yo-yo
I threw it down and it came back up
so I don't understand how that's a yo-yo anyway
but no it's not even going to be
an upside down yo-yo
now I know people do around the world
and stuff don't give me that
but anyway the bottom line is
that there's going to be
several years between
the rapture and Jesus
coming on a white horse and Armageddon
with the saints
no question about it
but God's wrath is not until after the tribulation
and that wrath takes years
for God to pour out
and as he destroys them
then destroy the earth is what he calls it
other people will say this
they say oh it's like a yo-yo
but Matthew 24 is not the rapture
now it's funny that
sometimes it's the rapture when they want it to be
like when they say Jesus could come at any moment
and you say show me that in the Bible
they say well yeah no man know it the day or the hour
which is a verse from Matthew 24
and then five minutes later
oh Matthew 24 is not about the rapture
but they pull it out when they want to
to talk about how nobody knows the day or the hour
even though
he comes after the tribulation
that's the part they didn't notice
and this is what they'll say
look at 1st Thessalonians 4 real quick
and close with this
it's more of a Bible study than a sermon
but
you see
there are a lot of people today that just
to them the book of Revelation is this foreboding
book
that they can't be understood
it's so complicated
and you know what I have had many people
at least ten I'm not exaggerating
who've said to me independently
when I used to be taught the
the pre-tribulation rapture
I never understood the book of Revelation
I didn't even want to read it and study it because it confused me
and then they said as soon as
I learned the truth about this
they said now I love the book of Revelation
it makes sense to me I can comprehend it
it's clear
I had many people say that to me
because see the Bible is clear
but when you have a preconceived idea
that little leaven
will leaven the whole lot with the book of Revelation for you
and you can't figure it out
it doesn't make any sense
look at 1st Thessalonians 4
there's another thing that people will say
they'll say well you know
when the rapture takes place
the Lord himself is the one
who comes
and takes us out
whereas in Matthew 24 it says
he'll send his angels to gather
the elect
so totally different events right
well look at this hold on a second
let's read 1st Thessalonians 4
it says
in verse number 16
for the Lord himself
shall descend from heaven
with a shout
and with the voice of the archangel
so we know that the voice of the archangel is definitely there
and the trump of God
and the dead in Christ shall rise
first then we which are alive
and remain shall be caught
up together with them in the clouds
now let me ask you something
if we have a phrase
we're caught up together
with them in the clouds
this sentence is called
and let's put on our grammar
we're gonna need a really deep grammar right now
when the subject of the sentence
is not doing the action
but is receiving the action
what do we call that sentence
passive
passive
is right passive
transitive
is that right
it's basically passive
because the subject is
receiving the action
well the subject there is
we
we which are alive and remain
aren't gonna catch anything up
we're going to be caught up
now when we use a passive verb like that
basically
somebody else is doing the action
so basically
we're being caught up
by the angels
you know
so what's their point
because Jesus Christ does not come down and catch us up
we meet him in the clouds
which proves that he is not the one
that is coming down and catching us up
in the clouds
because we meet him there
if he were the one that would catch us up
he'd be meeting us down here
and bringing us up
no we are caught up by the angels
to meet him in the air
I mean it's that simple
we're caught up together with them in the clouds
to meet the Lord in the air
and so shall we ever be with the Lord
don't let people deceive you on this
and it's not complicated
and really the sermon was about
the second coming of Jesus Christ
and about the rapture
but you could apply these principles
it's just a good lesson
in how to say it
really just quit studying the Bible and start reading it
it would probably be a good place to start
just read it
and just read it for what it's said
don't try to twist it, don't try to change it
and don't have a preconceived idea
just read it, let God speak to you
let God show you the truth
you say who taught you that Pastor Anderson
who got you into this
who got you messed up on this thing
this cake that you're on
you know what
it's been since I was 12
and I just picked it up and read it
and it's that simple
it's that simple now
you know after that I did more reading
I did more study, talked to other people, heard other sermons
and you know it just all did was just reinforce
what I saw when I was 12
because it's not that complicated
and if it's complicated it's probably not right
you see God
wrote the Bible for you to understand it
not for Pastor Anderson to have to just break everything down to you
when you go home
tonight and you go to bed
and you wake up tomorrow morning
pick up the Bible and read it
and just read it for what it says
it'll make sense to you, God will show you what it means
you don't need any man to teach you
let the Bible teach you
and do some serious Bible reading
because our generation is ignorant of the Bible
and that's why it's easy for them to sit in church
we get the weekend and shout amen
I'm sorry I have to say this one thing
I heard a sermon
from a guy that I knew
I used to go to church with him
and he passes a church now
and he's preaching about
the pre-tribulation rapture
right
and since this guy was an old friend of mine
I thought you know I'm just going to listen to it for kicks
what are they saying
this pre-trips are
and I heard about
usually when I was in church they didn't really go into it
because it's so hard to explain
they would just kind of
pre-trip
they didn't really talk about it
they would just kind of go on to the next point
you don't believe it you're calling Jesus a liar
somebody say amen and just kind of move on to the next point
but this was a whole sermon about the rapture
I said man I got to hear this
so I'm listening to the sermon
and he's going through Matthew 24 of all places
I'm like Matthew 24 this is going to be good
he's reading through it
and this really disappointed me
he started getting close
to the
scary verse 29
that after the tribulation verse
okay
and here's what he said
this got me mad
he got around 26, 27
he started getting a little bit too close for comfort
because what if
you don't even want to get into verse 28
because what if somebody's eyes just kind of get ahead of the reader
you know what I'm saying
and what if they see that phrase immediately after the tribulation
because they're reading a little head of the pastor
so you got to keep a buffer zone
a couple verses before and a couple verses after
okay
so he gets within that buffer zone
the little red light starts to come on
and here's what he said
and this disappointed me
he said well we all know the rest of the story
let's skip down to verse 30, 35
I think it was
we all know the story
let's skip to 35
you're a liar
it'd be one thing to just
be mixed up
just sit there and say
let's skip it because you know the story
I mean you could have just said jump down to verse 35
that would have been one thing
but to lie and say it's because we already know the story
he jumps down to verse 35
and twists the Bible
or whatever verse he jumped down to
but this is the real funny part
I haven't gotten to the funny part yet
that's not funny, that's sad
he's preaching along
and he accidentally
and by the way
he makes mistakes while I was preaching
like sometimes I'll mix up heaven and hell
who's hurt me within the last two weeks
make some real messes up
why are all these hands going up
I heard a little snippet
of a sermon that I preached like a week and a half ago
and I said something totally off the wall
like I'll be saying that
you know
I don't know like that if you're saved
you're going to hell
you know everybody does it
you know you make mistakes
in front of people
you freeze up
you say the wrong thing
and I've done it many times
well this pastor was having one of those kind of moments
and he accidentally
for about five minutes kept calling the tribulation
the rapture
you know he just had it in his head
you know how you do
so he's preaching and he says
we're going to miss the rapture
this is much funny
a guy says amen
so a guy says
amen
now when I was listening to this sermon
a lot of people are saying amen throughout the sermon
but he gets to this part
and he got a little bit less amen
when he says we're going to miss the rapture
this guy's like amen
but then the pastor
you can tell was thinking that wasn't enough amen
so he said I mean come on
we're going to miss the rapture right
and then you hear like five people
say amen
so then he's going on for like five minutes
talking about
we're going to miss the rapture
and then he's like I'm pre rapture
like you're going to say
he's like I'm pre rapture
I'm sure
and then finally he figures it out
he's like oh whoops I've been saying rapture
he's like pre rapture
I guess that's if you die you know
before it comes
before the rapture
but just to show you don't be a robot
that says amen
you know we're going to miss the rapture
amen
at least when I say dumb things he gets quiet
right
as far as the word for it
father we love you and thank you for the bible dear god
I thank you so much that I have the whole word of god
I thank god that it's in my language
that somebody doesn't have to get up behind a pulpit
and translate it to me
and I have to be at the mercy of some priest
for me I thank god that it's in my
hand and that the holy spirit
is the ultimate bible teacher
living inside of me
leading me and guiding me into all truth
thank you so much for your promises dear god
thank you that the bible is written to me
and that it's all profitable for doctrine
to me as the believer
as the man of god for all instruction
and righteousness to be truly furnished
and all good works help us all dear god
to read it love it study it
eat breathe and sleep your word
and we love you and in Jesus name we pray amen
