Man starting out in the book of Exodus here chapter one the Bible reads now
these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt every man
in his household came with Jacob Ruben Simeon Levi and Judah Isaac Arzebulin
and Benjamin Dan and Naphtali Gad and Asher and all the souls that came out of
the loins of Jacob were 70 souls for Joseph was in Egypt already so the book
is called Exodus because Exo means out Odos means the road okay so it's
basically a departure or the road out think of an odometer okay so this is
about the children of Israel leaving Egypt that's the main subject matter of
the book that's why the book starts out with the names of the children of Israel
which came into Egypt so we start out with them going in and the story is all
about them being there and going out of Egypt that's the main theme in the book
of Exodus now Exodus chapter one is extremely relevant to the day in which
we live because of the fact that Egypt in the Bible pictures the sinful world
that we live in and there are so many things in this chapter that are
applicable today there's nothing new under the Sun and so the things that we
see in this chapter are happening around us as we speak all right so let's look
at some of these things as we go down through this chapter it says in verse
six and Joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation and the children
of Israel who are obviously God's people living amongst a sinful world right the
children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and
waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with them so this is God's will
for us as Christians to be fruitful and multiply this is a major theme all
throughout the Bible even going back to Adam and Eve going back to Noah going
back to Jacob and all these people that they would be fruitful and multiplying
and and God said surely blessing I will bless you and multiplying I will
multiply you so multiplication is a blessing from God being fruitful is a
blessing so if you have a lot of children that's a blessing okay if the
church is growing and multiplying that's a good thing right we want there to be
more Christians next year than there were last year want to constantly be
reaching people and growing and bringing forth fruit and multiplying so God's
people are being fruitful they're increasing they're multiplying and
that's a great thing but when the world sees that when the devil sees that he
doesn't like that he doesn't want God's people to multiply either physically or
spiritually okay so it says in verse 8 now there arose up a new king over Egypt
which knew not Joseph and he said into his people behold the people of the
children of Israel are more and mightier than we come on let us deal wisely with
them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when they're fall without any
war they join also under our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out
of the land therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with
their burdens and they built for Pharaoh treasure cities python and Ramses so
what we see here is that when God's people do the right thing when they're
living godly in Christ Jesus they're going to suffer persecution all that will
live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution and when we're multiplying
greatly the devil is going to try to fight us the world is going to try to
stop us first of all they don't want us having a lot of kids right they want to
brainwash Christians today not to be fruitful and multiply that's why your
average independent Baptist church they're not having a lot of kids they'll
typically have two kids maybe three kids they have four kids it's considered a
really big family they're encouraging their people to use birth control I
remember when I was in Bible college they had a mandatory meeting for every girl
who's getting married and they just sat them down and just indoctrinated them on
birth control and it was required that all the Bible college students get this
birth control indoctrination and they would have birth control pills literally
issued to them on the campus of the Bible college they're doling out in the
clinic you know they have a little nurse and doctor on staff the college
clinic and they're giving out the birth control literally on the Bible college
campus I've heard preachers get up and preach against having a big family and
how it's gonna slow you down from serving God and and just all this nonsense
folks God wants us to be fruitful and multiply having children is a blessing
happy is the man that have this quiver full of them right and so we need to get
back to that kind of a belief amongst God's people where even if the world is
telling us oh we're overpopulated and you know don't have too many kids and wait
two years you know so you can get to know your wife or how about getting to
know her before you get married would be a good thing number one okay but then
number two after you get married you're gonna have at least nine months where
it's just the two of you okay and here's the other thing about that when you just
have a little baby you know they don't really interrupt your conversations and
and say well you might I had you know now obviously they cry and things but you
know you still feel like you have privacy look when my wife and I go out on a
date with just the baby we feel like we're alone because you know what being
alone is relative my friend all right when you have ten kids if we just take
the baby we we call that a night out alone because the baby you know isn't
part of the conversation all right just as long as you keep the food and drink
coming toward the baby it'll be as happy as a clam and so this this doctrine that
says oh you need to wait two years I'll tell you where that's really coming from
the fundamental Baptist didn't come up with that it comes from Margaret Sanger
comes from planned barren hood okay and it comes from a wicked person who was
pushing abortion and everything else and here's what Margaret Sanger said she
said you need to wait two years before you have kids because she said you need
to make sure that the marriage is gonna work out well guess what when we get
married as independent fundamental Baptist we get married as a Christian when
we get married as one who believes in the word of God it's do or die literally do
or die till death do us part so we're not in some waiting period like well we
don't want to produce children for the first two years because what if it
doesn't work out and then today we have these young girls getting on birth
control when they get married and doing that for two years well guess what if
you're on birth control for x amount of time you have to be off birth control for
that same amount of time before you can expect to for sure get pregnant or or
to have metabolized all that stuff so if you're on birth control for seven years
it could take up to seven years for your body to recover from the effects of that
birth control it's not like you could just be on birth control for years and
then all of a sudden just flip a switch and it's like alright I'm ready to have
a kid now you've already been training your body not to have a kid you know it's
not always that easy and sometimes you could have done permanent damage to your
body to the point where you can't have kids so now infertility is epidemic and
obviously there are a lot of reasons for infertility and you know some of them are
biological some of them could be hereditary some some of them could just
be you know health problems or it could be all manner of different reasons or
God just chooses to open and close the womb for whatever reason and in his
wisdom we just have to accept that his way is perfect and wait on his timing and
you know if you can't have kids you pray to the Lord that he'll open the womb
etc but we see just the statistics of infertility rising amongst men and
women and part of it is all the birth control is being used okay and then
people go to try to have kids after they've already used it and a lot of
times they struggle because of that also it's just getting into the water
supply because so many women are taking birth control and then it gets into the
water supply and then everybody's getting a little bit of birth control you
know from the tap water or whatever so you know these things are not of God
alright we need to bring back a culture at least amongst God's people that says
hey let's get married let's have kids let's be fruitful let's multiply we
don't need to use birth control we don't need to artificially tamper with God's
plan there and look my children are naturally spaced about two years apart
and we don't use any birth control so you're not gonna have a kid every nine
months okay necessarily now you know the way that our kids are spaced out is
just through breastfeeding you know by by my wife breastfeeding the baby and
following certain rules that allows the babies to be naturally spaced her periods
don't come back for like a year after she has a baby because of the fact that
she's breastfeeding exclusively and there are certain rules that you have to
follow in order to make that work this is knowledge that used to be passed from
mother to daughter and and that people used to just know about now if you tell
a doctor sometimes about lactational amineria they don't even know what
you're talking about or they'll tell you all that doesn't work really that's fine
because it's worked for me for the last 18 years okay none of my kids are nine
months apart my kids are all spaced out and we don't use any birth control so
there you go folks now obviously you need to read up on that and and follow the
wisdom since your mom didn't teach you you're gonna have to go to mother Google
to teach you that but it's true you know this is the knowledge that man has had
that's why in Hosea it says that when she had weaned lohu Ruhama then she
conceived you know after she weaned the baby she conceived why because those
things are related need to look into that amen so we want to multiply but it's
not just physically it's not just that we want to have a bunch of kids we want
to have some spiritual children right we want to have our sons and daughters in
the faith people that we beget like Paul where he said I've beget
onesimists in my bonds when he was in jail he beget someone he won someone to
Christ that was his son in the faith and so we want to have some spiritual
children okay so even if you can't have physical children you can have
spiritual children amen and when people to Christ and and and hopefully we can
have both right and multiply physically and spiritually it's a good thing it's
a blessing and it talks about how they multiplied and the king didn't like that
and so he began to persecute them and afflict them you know if a church is
outreaching people and getting people saved and growing there's gonna be
persecution Paul said that a great door was opened and effectual for him to
preach the gospel but then he followed that up by saying and there are many
adversaries so if you're a do nothing church that's just us four no more
high steeple few people and nothing's even happening you're not gonna get
persecuted but when you actually start preaching hard and winning people to
Christ making an impact when the converts are being baptized that's when
the persecution is going to inevitably come okay and so that's what happens here
God's people are being afflicted because they're multiplying because they're
living godly in Christ Jesus because they're being blessed by God and it says
here in verse 12 but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied
and grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel the more they
afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and it's the same thing in the
book of Acts when there was a great persecution in the book of Acts then they
that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the gospel so by
persecuting God's people it just scattered them everywhere preaching the
gospel in more places so it actually helped the gospel go forward see
persecution that comes to Christians is a blessing we're to rejoice when we're
persecuted we're to leap for joy all things work together for good to them
that love God and to them where the cold according to his purpose that means
even when I'm persecuted that's working together for good everything that
happens works together for good to them that love God that's what the Bible says
so any persecution that comes we should rejoice we should leap for joy and I'm
not just saying that this isn't just some kind of a line of yeah we're supposed
to rejoice I'm I'm literally saying rejoice literal rejoicing that's what I
do you know when when we get banned from a country when they shut down this or
shut down that you know it can be annoying when you have to change plans
and the logistics and everything but you know what we ought to be rejoicing and
praising God and just thankful for the persecution when the when the protesters
have been out here and and protested outside our church you know that's been
a blessing it's it's cheaper than waving a sign waiver you know you hire a sign
waiver companies pay somebody to stand out there and dance around you know I
mean we have people do it for free hey this guy's preaching hate in here it's
like oh really well what time is the service start sounds great this guy
hates homos where's this guy been all my life you know this is my pastor you
know that you know it kids guess what not everybody thinks like they do they
think everybody's some flaming liberal they think everybody is some weirdo
folks there are still 7,000 men that haven't bound the need of bail and you
know it's funny we haven't had any protesters out there for about three
years now and let me tell you exactly why we haven't had any protesters actually
I'm sorry it's been four years now since we've had any protesters out there and
I'll tell you why because finally the devil's crowd in our area got smart
enough to figure out wait a minute the more we afflict them the more they
multiply and grew and they they literally in 2015 in the spring so four
years ago now they had a press conference where they said we're not
going to talk about Pastor Anderson anymore in the media define irony let's
have a press conference talking about Pastor Anderson how we're not going to
talk about him anymore but this is the last time okay okay so we're gonna stop
talking about Pastor Anderson right now so they literally had this press
conference brother Ramon Ventura was there he filmed it for us so I watched
it on video and they had this big meeting where they they got together with
the congressman and the and the media and everything and they said hey we need
to stop talking about this guy because all we're doing is just spreading his
message all we're doing is just helping people find out about this church so
there was a big protest planned in 2015 and they canceled it they said we're
asking the organizers to cancel the protest we're not covering them anymore
and the media used to always call me up and want to interview me like when big
things would happen they'd call me up and do an interview none of the media has
contacted me for the last four years except for foreign countries and the
Spanish station they didn't get the memo because they don't speak English so I
the only interview the only local interviews I've done last four years has
been una vision and telemundo that's it okay and then reporters will come from
the Netherlands and Sweden and whatever but the local reporters don't come
because they made an agreement don't talk about faithful word Baptist Church
because the more they afflict us the more we multiply and grow that's why and
they finally figured that out and realized that but what's so stupid is the
azcentral.com just did an article on our church this week and they're so
behind the times they're called the news right the news they show a picture of
me sticking my head out the door of the church building and it says this picture
taken in 2009 is Pastor Harrison sticking his head out the door of the
church building so basically I've been in hiding for the last ten years there's
no photograph of me for the last ten years no video I've been completely in
hiding here is a rare photo from ten years ago of Pastor Harrison peeking his
head out the door and everybody took a picture real fast that look I'm not
kidding look it up that's what I have a newspaper a picture of me from ten years
ago and it even says this is from 2009 well have you thought about an update
there brother stupid right the folks the media is a joke it's a joke friend who
takes these people seriously you know what this is the truth right here the
word of God if you want the truth you come to church and listen the word of
God preach you don't listen to the lame stream media with their picture from
2009 and then they're like oh his church has often drawn protests yeah four
years ago why don't you guys catch up nobody has protested our church in the
last four years but they're there they're got a picture from ten years ago a
news story from four years ago folks I got a book from you know three thousand
five hundred years ago and it's more relevant than the junk they're putting
out every day man so we've got here a story in the Bible that mirrors what we
see today where God's people are multiplying they're growing the devil
doesn't like it the world doesn't like it persecution comes down and then they
just multiply and grow they do better you know when when when when I got banned
from South Africa now I have three times as many listeners in South Africa thank
you for banning me okay because now I have three times as many listeners overnight
because you banned me and it was all over the news and everything like that and I
didn't really want to go to South Africa that much anyway all right I wasn't
going there for my own benefit I was going there to try to preach to them to
help them to be a blessing to them I'm not going there for myself if I was
going there for myself I'd probably pick a country other than the rape capital of
the world where you could pay somebody fifty dollars to murder someone great
place folks that place is a hellhole okay that place and by the way it's been
cursed by God ever since they banned me even more they've been having drought and
famine and economic problems murder rape pillage it's all going up it's all
getting worse how could God bless them when they have denied the preachers it
wasn't just me there's a whole bunch of soul winners and preachers that were all
going there to minister and they banned all of us now most countries only ban me
and then everybody else goes in South Africa is the one country that banned all
of us I mean they didn't just ban me they banned Pastor Dave Bursons they
passed they banned Pastor Roger Jimenez they banned my wife they banned their
wives they banned Paul Wittenberger's wife I mean they banned they banned
everybody and their wife okay they probably bet probably other people whose
name is Steven Anderson probably can't even get into that country you know just
other Steven Anderson's are struggling to enter South Africa now apparently so
anyway the more they afflict us the more we multiply and grew that's why we
should rejoice when persecution comes it makes us stronger it builds our faith
the trying of our faith is like the trying of gold in the fire so we do best
when we're being persecuted or when we're in a fight that's when we're at our
finest hour as God's people so the more they afflicted them the more they
multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of Israel
folks it grieves this wicked world when they see God's people living right and
serving God they they're just grieved why can't they just let us do our thing
why can't they just let us believe the Word of God and preach the Word of God
they don't want to let it happen because they know how powerful it is and they
don't want it to spread you want to try to stop it but in trying to stop it it
ends up spreading more they can't say they've been trying for the last few
thousand years to stop it folks and here we are 2019 years after the birth of
Christ and it's still going strong the Word of God's the bestseller you know
they the different men have talked about how we're gonna get rid of the Bible
you know the French Revolution there were radical atheists talking about how
you know we're gonna get rid of the Word of God we're gonna get rid of
Christianity we're gonna burn all the Bibles really because here we are and
there are more Bibles on this planet today than there have ever been on any
other day in the history of this planet right now in May of 2019 there are more
Bibles now than there have ever been in the history of mankind Bibles everywhere
there are more copies of the Word of God available it's easier to get your hands
on than ever it's everywhere and the preachings everywhere it's easy to get
the preaching it's easy to get the book itself it's everywhere you know John
Lennon said that oh well you know 50 years from now I forget the exact quote
he said you know people are still gonna be listening to the Beatles but they're
not gonna care about Jesus anymore we're more popular than Jesus Christ right now
that's what John Lennon said and and you know when when when when people stop
believing in Jesus they'll still be listening to Beatles well you know what
less and less people I think are listening to Beatles maybe I'm wrong
about that I don't know maybe young people just love the Beatles or some you
know they just really want to hold your hand and all that but let me tell you
something I think there are oh I think Christianity is going up and the Beatles
are going down and several of the Beatles are already down there okay I think
what three out of four of them are already down there or are all four of
them reunited there in hell two really you Beatles fans you worldly people you
know all this how do you know that so in Exodus chapter one the more they
afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew they were grieved because of
the children of Israel what just bought it's just like just like Kane was grieved
by Abel right they just can't take it when someone's serving God and the
Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor and they made their
lives bitter with hard bondage in mortar and in brick and in all manner of
service in the field all their service wherein they made them serve was with
rigor and the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives of which the name of the
one was Shifra and the name of the other Pua and he said when you do the office
of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it be a son
then you shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live so we see
that the world's agenda and the devil's agenda is to eradicate men to eradicate
men okay men are the ones who are going to stand up and fight the Lord's battles
and be on the front lines of the actual fight itself right you know they weren't
worried about the Hebrew women siding with their enemies in a war and taking
up swords and shields and spear they weren't worried about that they're
worried about the men okay now obviously women play a super important role in
Christianity in the church in the family obviously women are very important and we
as God's people understand that women are as valuable as men that's what we
understand that in Christ there is neither male nor female and so men and
women both have equivalent value but the world though downgrades women now
they'll lie and try to make it the other way around oh you Christians you the
great women really because I'm not the one telling them not to act like women
see I'm up here celebrating femininity tonight okay right I'm up here
celebrating femininity saying hey it's great to be a wife to be a mother to
stay at home right that's a blessing that's a position of honor you're not
just a homemaker you're a homemaker with a capital H I mean you know you're not
just you're not unemployed don't put my wife in some unemployment statistic she's
not unemployed she is doing the most important job that a woman could ever do
and you know what I'm here to celebrate femininity tonight by telling women to
wear skirts and dresses it's so feminine embrace your femininity but the world
they act like they love you but they really hate you so they tell you hey
you have to dress like a man act like a man live like a man do the jobs that a
man does they're telling you that you don't have value unless you do men's
work I'm telling you that you have value just the way you are just the way God
made you a woman being a woman it's great right men being men women being
women the world wants to take women and turn them into men but even more than
that they want to take men and turn them into women they hate a hair-legged man
who stands up and preaches God's word that's their greatest nightmare is a
warrior their greatest nightmare is a man who acts like a man okay this is what
they hate more than anything a man who's a husband and a father and he rules
his home and he's a servant of God they don't like that so they want to
emasculate men they want to feminize men here in this story they said hey we're
gonna kill the men and we're gonna save the females alive we're gonna save the
the girls alive and throw all the boys in the river right murder all the boys
they're trying to eradicate manhood is what they're doing there okay they don't
want the men and you know what there are a lot of churches today where you walk
in and there are very few men in the church it's a lot of women in the
church women children and then the men that are there are a little bit soft
right and that's putting it nicely see what the devil doesn't want is a church
full of manly men that can go out and and fight the Lord's battles being
supported by godly women that are raising that godly next generation and
that are providing a supporting role to their husband you say well I don't have
children yet but you know what support your husband be that godly wife that
godly homemaker that godly helper so that he's Adam and he's got his eve with
him the help that is meet for him that's the purpose folks but the devil hates
that the world hates that and so they want to tell women to go out and act like
men and do men's jobs and then the men are feminized and and you know what this
effeminate garbage needs to stop amongst God's people look okay so the world's
going to do that okay if the world wants to go out and get all k-pop in synced
out and backstreet boyed out and get all effeminate and queer looking you know
that's fine but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord and you know it's
sad that now you go to independent fundamental Baptist churches and you see
these feminized man these queer baits and sissies folks we need to be manly and
I'm not saying to have some overly manliness or something right like
that meme what there's a meme called the overly manly man right you know I'm not
saying you have to be like that guy all right but what I am saying is that you
need to be masculine quit this feminine queer looking crap okay skinny jeans no
just no no skinny jeans right and and what what's with all the pinks and the
lavender oh you're so pretty why don't you go to the men's department and put on
some real clothes okay and and you know getting all decorated folks women get
decorated men don't put that much time and effort into their appearance and if
they do then they have queer tendencies I'm not kidding standing in front of the
mirror preening yourself you pretty boy that's not God's will for you be rugged
be man the man should not put on a woman's garment the woman should not
wear that which pertain it to a man man or to have short hair women to have
longer you know the principle behind that is that men are to look like men and
women to look like women it's not just hair and clothing let's just extra excuse
me extrapolate that into all areas of life that men be men and women be women
that they be different from one another right and and folks we need this in
2019 more than we've ever needed it why would churches be backing down on this at
a time when now in 17 different states a boy can identify as a girl and go
compete against female athletes and get first prize in 17 states folks some dude
decides to become a girl or something and then he goes out and wins at the 55
meter sprint or the 100 meter dash or whatever because he's a dude because men
are genetically able to run faster at a short distance than women that's why they
even have a women's event and a men's event but now the women's event is just
become a tranny event it's the I mean forget about girls sports now it's just
it's all trannies now because how can they compete with the tranny you know
he's got he's got male DNA male hormones of course he's gonna smoke these
girls in a race there's no glory in that I mean they even have these transvestites
now in in mixed martial arts a man beating up a woman and being rewarded
for that it's disgusting and so this is the world we're living in now where
there's the drag time drag Queen story hour and we got men competing in girls
sports beating up girls running faster than girls out jumping and pole vaulting
and discus throwing the girls right this is the bizarre twilight zone that
we're living in today and then now is the time hey let's just back off on that
right and that's the time for us now as babes hey let's just back off on that
whole women and pants thing you know let's just back off on that whole you
know feminine clothing and masculine clothing no folks it's time to tighten
that up if anything we need more distinction in a world that's gone
crazy we need more not less and you know what sometimes I feel kind of bad when
some Metro doubt dude walks into our church or walks into another church that
we're friendly with and I see people like kind of looking at this guy like is
this guy queer or what you know I'm talking about and they're kind of like
you know they're they're wondering and I always feel kind of bad because I know
that the guy's not a homo but that he's just he's just a product of our 2019
American culture and so I'm kind of like hey guys calm down you know this guy's
he's not a queer he just looks like one you know but but but at the end of the
day even though I feel kind of bad about it at the end of the day though it's
really that guy's fault for walking in to a Bible believing church all queer
looking and Metro doubt you know why don't you just dress manly quit looking
at GQ and quit looking at all your little fashion magazines and go down to
the uniform store and get some actual manly clothes that fit and show up
looking like a real man who goes to work every day not some kind of a French
queer looking fashion model or something right you know what I'm talking about
folks you know with your with your $50 haircut what what go like this and just
cut whatever's above your fingers that's your haircut all right good night but
they got their little they're all preened and pretty and all Metro doubt and
everything it's really it's just it's wrong and it's in I'm sick of it and you
know it it will never be the culture here if that becomes a culture here then
I'll just get up and just preach about it every Sunday you know what I mean folks
there's got to be some place left on the planet where a man is still a man and a
woman is still a woman amen and you just walked into it it's faithful word Baptist
church so you know they hate men they want to they want to emasculate the men
you know how is the thief going to enter into the strong man's house and spoil
his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he'll spoil his house
then he'll spoil his goods you know the devil wants men's hands to be tied and
men to be weak and effeminate so that they can't be strong in the Lord and the
power of his might and fight the good fight right so they want to take the
fight out of men and then a man gets up and preaches with a little bit of fight
in the sermon right oh hate speech hate speech right up oh he's fighting the
good fight that's hateful right everything's hateful now any hard
preaching is just hateful doesn't matter what you're preaching hard about it's
automatically hate speech I preach the sermon against birth control and it was
labeled hate speech by and look sometimes I do preach hate because I do
hate evil but sometimes I preach stuff that's not even hateful it's like well
okay yeah I preached something hateful last week but this wasn't hateful at all
and you're still calling it hateful because just anything negative is hateful
today it's just a way to silence and shut up God's people from preaching it's
just a way to afflict them and bind them put them in bondage and so that they
can't get up and preach and say what needs to be said folks it's the agenda of
the devil to eradicate men that's what he's trying to do here right get rid of
the men throw them the boys in the river so they don't go grow up to be men right
and then the men that are there let's put them in chains and bondage so they
can't fight or do anything right well we need to make sure that we produce a
generation of real men you know and that we don't buy into all this
sysified stuff and you know what if you don't want your children to grow up
sysified here are some tips don't let them idolize a bunch of sissies on TV
movies and the music industry you know don't have them listening to a bunch of
queer music if you don't want them to grow up and have a feminine tendencies if
that's who their role models are that's what they're gonna do okay so you and
you need to model the way for them by showing them a good example of a godly
man in the home and not only that but you need to teach your boys to be rugged
you know to get out there and do stuff and to do hard things you know like for
example you know I took my kids hiking I don't know if it was yesterday or a
couple days ago but I took my kids hiking and you know my six-year-old son
Steven was out there and he got a blister on his foot you know and he kept on
going he pushed through I mean look that kind of stuff is good for you to do
something hard you know to go out and go through pain and we're and he had a
great time he enjoyed it you know get out there and do stuff don't just be
glued to a screen all day glued to the smartphone glued to the TV glued to the
video game just sitting around man get out there and do some stuff right get
some some fresh air sunshine and get a little rugged skin the knee get the
blisters get out there and and and experience a little bit of pain in your
life so that you're not just completely soft and coddled and then you have no
backbone then you get to be an adult and this you're like these preachers
where the slightest little persecution and they go running away with their tail
between their legs scared of their own shadow folks it's a feminine if they
were manly then they would stand up for what they believe they'd stand up and
say no this is what we believe this is what the Bible says and you know what if
you don't like it tough like it or love it that's what men do behind the pulpit
they get up and they preach God's word they say does say it the Lord and when
somebody doesn't like it if they say well you know well thus saying thou
reproaches us also well what do you also what want you lawyers that's what
they do they dig in and they preach what needs to be preached that's what we
need so he wants to eradicate the men you know he said in verse 16 when you do
the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it
be a son then you shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live then
down at the end it says in verse 22 and Pharaoh charged all his people saying
every son that's born you shall cast into the river and every daughter you
shall save a life well isn't this wicked can you imagine taking a newborn baby
and killing it can you imagine just taking a newborn baby in your hands and
throwing it in a river just walking up to the river and just hurling in a new
born baby you know what you would have to be such a sick evil wicked disgusting
person and you know that's why when the king Pharaoh commanded the midwives to
do that you know what they didn't do they didn't do it they refused to do it
why because they weren't sick depraved individuals and so they didn't do it they
refused to do it they did right and God bless them okay even though they lied
about it because they said oh well you know by the Hebrew women man they just
give birth so fast and we got there and they'd already given birth so it's too
late you know what because they weren't sick people perverted depraved
monsters they could actually take a newborn baby and hurl it in the river
but folks there's a river that babies are being hurled into right now it's
called Planned Parenthood there's a bit there's a river that newborn babies are
being hurled into right now it's called the abortion clinic folks and it's it's
more than than Pharaoh could have ever thought of killing it's more than King
Herod could have ever thought of killing boy the United States has a river of
blood from all of the babies that have been aborted and you know what that's
why God turned the Nile River into blood all right to punish them that's what
they deserve just like in the end times he said they've shed the blood of saints
and prophets and you've given them blood to drink because they're worthy well
you know what the Egyptians shed the blood of innocent babies because these
midwives were righteous but there were babies that did end up getting killed
clearly obviously Moses was spared he had to be hidden away and they had to hide
him for three months and everything like that they shed that blood and you know
what they end up drinking blood you know America's gonna drink blood one day for
all of the abortion and the wickedness that they've done you know it's funny
though the one country that hasn't banned me yet in Europe Ireland there
they've been really just kind of melting down in the media the last couple
days they're just all freaking out and all the stories about how you know
Pastor Anderson is still coming to Ireland and you know whatever and this
is what they keep talking about oh well you know he's probably trying to change
us on abortion that's why they think I'm going there because they just made
abortion legal just a few years ago it's a new thing I don't remember exactly
when it was but it was in the last year or two or whatever and it was like a
landslide I think it was like two-thirds of the people voted for abortion it was
it was overwhelmingly brought in I don't remember exactly what the numbers are but
Ireland overwhelmingly brought in abortion you know that's the fruit of
the Roman Catholic Church right you know oh man we're all you were all so
Catholic over here in Ireland well I thought Catholics are supposed to be
against abortion I thought that's like the only thing people can ever bring up
to you good about the Catholic Church well hey at least they're pro-life at
least they're pro-life though it's like they don't have that going for them it's
like come on two-thirds of the people overwhelmingly brought in abortion and
then a preacher is coming to preach I'm not even going there about abortion I'm
not even going there to preach about sodomites I'm going there to do soul
winning right to preach the gospel I'm there to preach Christ crucified I'm
there to evangelize and knock doors but these people are shaking in their
boots oh no somebody's gonna take away our right to murder babies boy what a
sick depraved evil country Ireland is and you know what Ireland is on its way
to hell Ireland is on a bobsled to hell Ireland is a wicked place Ireland is
gonna face the wrath of God they're wicked their idolatrous Roman Catholic
Church is wicked their pagan priest Papa is wicked calling himself father and
dressing like a homo dressing in a dress all effeminate and queer teaching lies
and hypocrisy his conscious seared with a hot iron boy the wicked mother of
harlots abomination Roman Catholic Church mystery Babylon religion of Ireland
is rotten and you know what these bunch of people who voted in abortion two-thirds
of the people are a bunch of rotten people you rotten hey if you if anybody
in Ireland voted for that they're a rotten person there I said it you're a
rotten person that means more than half of your country is rotten two-thirds of
you are rotten wicked your country's an abomination Ireland is a wicked
abomination of a place you say why are you going there you know what I'm going
there just to reach a few people that's why I'm going there to reach a few
people I'm going there because I know there are godly Christians in Ireland
there are a lot of godly Christians in Ireland but in the scheme of Ireland
they're a very small minority but I mean even just the ones who listen to my
sermons there are thousands of people in Ireland who listen to my sermons and
I'm going there for them you know I'm going there for the people who actually
love the Lord who love the Word of God who love the preaching that comes out of
our church or other godly churches I'm going there for them to encourage them
to motivate them to be a blessing them and you know what we're gonna do we're
gonna go out we're gonna knock some doors and we're gonna find and you know
we're even gonna find some of those rotten people that voted in abortion and
you know what we're gonna get them saved and then they won't be rotten
anymore then they won't be such a rotten person anymore but you know what
right now they're a rotten person there are wretches what they are you know what
they are they're a scummy individual if they're oh yes let's vote so we can
murder babies you sick freak but you know what hey I want to get some of those
people saved so they can stop being such a rotten person so that Christ can make
them a new creature because right now they're on their way straight to hell and
so look I'm going there for the individual I'm not trying to change that
country you know why would I spend my life on something that is a lost cause
life's too short to spend it on a lost cause trying to fix Ireland is a lost
cause trying to fix the United States is a lost cause trying to stop abortion in
Ireland sorry lost cause you know what's gonna stop abortion in Ireland is
when God gives them blood to drink and reigns fire and brimstone from the sky
that's what's gonna stop it and you know what has always stopped it
throughout history heathen hordes of armies the heathen horde comes in and
that puts a stop to it fire and brimstone from the sky that puts a stop to it
the volcano erupts that puts a stop to it the tidal wave comes and that puts a
stop to it folks it's only the wrath of God whether it come through an invading
heathen horde or whether it come through natural disasters that will bring
wicked people like that to their knees but you know what I'm there to reach the
individual I'm there to encourage the seven thousand that have about the need
to bail I'm there to pull one lost soul out of the fire hey if I just go there
and win one person to Christ then you know what it's a success at that point
right I got that person saved but you know what we're gonna get way more than
one person saved because you know what when we have a hundred spirit filled
soul winners out there I don't know how many people are gonna show up but let's
say we have a hundred spirit filled soul winners out there folks we're gonna
come back rejoice and bring in our sheaves with us and you say well what if
you get paid what if you don't make it then there's gonna be 99 spirit filled
soul winners instead of a hundred and it's still gonna be great folks when we
read the Bible we see a reflection of our world this when you read don't just
read the Bible as oh this is ancient stories from long long ago no this is a
story from yesterday because the same things keep happening in our world the
world look there are still pharaohs in this world there are still the the
shifras and the puas of this world there are still the children of Israel of
this world and there are the Egyptians of this world and the pharaohs and the
josephs and the mosuses and the errands and the jocobeds and folks it's the same
there's nothing new under the sun people are people and it keeps repeating
over and over again right the same thing same thing so when you read the Bible
you got to see the day that we live in here you see the infanticide you see the
murdering of babies you see the the anger at God's people thriving and
succeeding and growing and being fruitful and things going well for them you
see that the eradication of manhood getting rid of the men folks it's all
happening okay and the Bible is teaching about what's gonna happen in the end
there of you know at the end of this chapter it's just every son's getting
thrown in the river but guess what then we get into chapter 2 chapter 3 chapter
4 and you know in the end the wicked get punished and God's people make it to the
promised land that's the way the story ends alright spoiler alert that's how
exodus ends they end up leaving alright and pharaoh and all of his people end up
suffering and being punished but you know what I guarantee you that a lot of
Egyptians are gonna get saved in the course of this story because the Bible
talks about later on how all the Egyptians who feared the Lord man when he
sent the hail to destroy the cattle they put their cattle inside they listen when
Moses preached they feared the Lord and you know even if an Egyptian were to put
the blood on the doorpost they shall be saved folks God used this to get a lot
of people saved so even when the heathen are raging even when Egypt is going
crazy and pharaoh is going crazy you know what there's still some of the
Egyptians that can be saved some of the irish or the Dutch or the Swedish they
can still be saved as a result they can be pulled out of the fire and you know
when it's all in the media and everything it just causes people to look
into it and learn about it and be saved so God is going to make sure that it all
works together for good in the end to those that love him and so we need to
just stay steadfast and unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord as
much as we know that our labor is not in vain in the Lord now if you're a woman
okay you know and you're married and you're having children don't ever think
oh man I wish I were out living like the world having the career you're already
doing the most important thing you're doing the most important thing just keep
doing what you're doing embrace your femininity and you know what if you're a
man you be a man and don't don't what do you try to get all pretty for you know
what what what you know and people are people are constantly criticizing me
for my hair and my clothing hey guess what I don't care you want to know why
my clothing is a little off because I don't care that's why I get I get all
these you know all these YouTube comments hey you need to get a tailor why so I
can wear some form-fitting suit hey as long as my suits within about three
sizes of what it's supposed to be I'm as long as it's as long as it's too big not
too small then I ask me if I care mr. queer eye for the straight guy okay you

fashion show and you say well I'm single I want the girls to like me guess what
girls like confidence not some queer little sissy pretty boy I don't care
what you look like men care about looks more than women do that's why women they
get all dolled up because men actually care about that women don't okay so quit
if you're single just dress like a man and if you're married you shouldn't be
trying to impress people with your appearance anyway just so long as your
wife is happy with the way that you look okay as long as am I okay honey am I
okay up here all right there we go that's see that I got the thumbs up on this
outfit sorry I'm not in 2019 style you know who cares folks we need men that
act like men and not like they're trying to win some kind of a fashion show or be
the prom king or something grow up put away childish things who cares you're
spending too much time on your appearance you have feminine tendencies
right so men be men women be women let's be fruitful let's multiply let's get
out there and win souls to Christ and you know what when the heathen rage and
when the persecution comes bring it on great rejoice all these reporters are
how do you feel about being banned feels a little awkward sometimes it feels
stinking good to be banned feels great but how does it make you feel on the
inside I don't know I mean I didn't even think that much about it okay I got
banned all right next thing move on folks who cares oh there's protesters
outside I'm afraid to go to church you spineless wimp oh that's right forgot
there's that chapter in Fox's book of martyrs about the people who had to go
through protesters from their car to the church remember that chapter it was
right it was right between the people being tortured and the people being
burned at the stake was that chapter about people had to walk through
protesters to get to church they had to go 50 feet from their car to church but
you know what when pastoring men is a church was surrounded by protesters
there are people who stayed home because they didn't even have the guts to get
out of their car and walk 50 feet with with sodomites hurling insults at them
folks you know that that should be one of the most glorious moments of your life
you know who was there who traveled to Verity on that day how did you feel
folks how did you feel when you walked through that gauntlet of literally 500
right five six hundred protesters who felt pretty good walking through that
like yeah it was fun I like that attitude folks if the devil
persecutes us we grow if he doesn't persecute us we grow anyway we're always
winning we're more than conquerors if God's for us who can be against us
folks is live your life the way that God wants you to live it and who cares what
people say right hey be a godly man be a godly woman if your family doesn't like
it tough I'm talking about extended family if your immediate family doesn't
like it you know then you might have some problems but I'm saying you know if
you're if your extended family doesn't like it then tough if the media doesn't
like it tough if the government doesn't like it tough if your preacher friends
don't like it tough just live your life it's between you and God and God's
gonna bless whether you're a man or woman just live your life for God and you
cannot fall you cannot fail everything will in the end work out great now look
are there gonna be some times where you're serving with rigor yeah I mean
that you know they went did they go through some tribulations in this
passage yeah they went through some affliction it said their lives were made
bitter with rigor and bondage but you know what in the end they're gonna come
out blessed they're gonna come out they're gonna cross the Red Sea they're
gonna see the mighty power of God it's worth it friend stay with the Lord stay
with church stay with the things of God and you're gonna come out like gold and
