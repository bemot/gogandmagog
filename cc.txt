Man, all right, what's the thing? Happy birthday to Brother Bruce Mahia. Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, Brother Mahia. Happy birthday to you.
All right. He's 33 years old today and his mom's here in the service with him to celebrate.
And we took him out to lunch and they sang to him at the Olive Garden, but they had a little extra
cha-cha-cha in there. So it's good to be here once again. Great work with the auditorium. Getting
a expanded. We got a full house tonight. Great to see everybody again and the new faces.
Tonight I'm going to preach a sermon called, he endured the cross. Let's start out at the beginning
of Hebrews chapter 12 there. The Bible reads in verse 1, wherefore seeing we also are
encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses. Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which
does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking under
Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him and doered the
cross, despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God for consider him
that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be worried and faint in your
minds. The Bible says that Jesus endured the cross for the joy that was set before him. He endured
the cross. He despised the shame, but he endured the cross. Now let's flip back over to Matthew
chapter 26 and we're going to go through the book of Matthew tonight and see what did that entail
when Jesus Christ endured the cross. What exactly did he endure? And we're just going to focus on
the gospel of Matthew. The book of Matthew is probably the most parallel with the book of Hebrews
because the gospel of Matthew is predominantly directed at the Hebrews more than any of the other
four gospels. So before we get into what Christ endured on the cross, let's just go to Matthew
chapter 26 and see where Jesus agonizing before he goes to the cross in the Garden of Gethsemane,
look at chapter 26 verse 36. The Bible says then come at Jesus with them unto a place called
Gethsemane and say it unto the disciples, say ye here while I go and pray yonder. And he took
with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. Then say
at the end of them, my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death, terry ye here and watch with me.
And he went a little further and fell on his face and prayed saying, oh my father, if it be
possible, let this cup pass from me, nevertheless not as I will, but as thou will. Now this is a very
powerful scene here in the Garden of Gethsemane. When Jesus takes his closest friends, his closest
disciples and he says to them, my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death. I mean he's just trying
to express how upset he is. I mean he's very sorrowful. What is it that's got him sorrowful? Obviously
he is dreading what he's going to have to go through the next day. It's the dread of the next day
and during the cross. And the Bible says he despised the shame. Obviously it was not pleasant or easy
to go through what he went through on the cross. He knows what's coming. He knows all the prophecies,
he knows what he's going to endure and he's very sorrowful even unto death and he wants his
closest friends to be with them there praying with them and to help him go through this time.
And when he gets on his face and praise, he says, oh my father, if it be possible, let this cup
pass from me, nevertheless not as I will, but is that what? Don't miss this. I mean Jesus Christ
did not just have an easy time. He wasn't just on autopilot or, okay yeah I'm going to go, I'm
going to die on the cross, I'm going to be buried and rising again. I mean this is something that he
asked to actually go through as a human being, okay. And he's dreading it, he's sorrowing through it
and I've heard some people try to twist this or sugar coat this or try to take away from
Christ's emotion here in the Garden of Gethsemane. I heard this dumb theory that when Jesus said,
let this cup pass from me, he's not actually saying that he doesn't want to go through with
his mission on the cross. They said, oh he's just nervous that he would accidentally die in the
Garden of Gethsemane because he sorrowed unto death. I mean come on that's just ridiculous. And they
said, you know, oh he had blood coming out of his sweat glands and that means he's about to die or
something. Well that's ridiculous because it says that the sweat that he was sweating was dripping
as it were great drops of blood which means that it wasn't blood, it was just dripping like blood
would drip. Basically he's just sweating so much that the sweat is dripping off of his face
as blood would drip from a wound is what the Bible is saying. He didn't actually have blood coming out
of his body when he's sweating there in the garden. And look this is just insane to say, oh well
he's just afraid he's going to accidentally die. No, no, no. He says, look if it be possible,
let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will but as thou will. What's he saying there?
He's saying, look if there's any other way. I don't want to go through this because obviously
humanly speaking, he despised the shame. He doesn't want to have to go through the horrible things
he's going to go through the next day. But he said, not as I will but as thou will. You know what
that shows us that Christ is the only way to heaven. If there was some other way for you to be saved
then he would have just said, okay great, let this cup pass from me then. There is no other way.
If it be possible, no it's not possible for that cup to pass from you and for people to be saved
because people can only be saved by Jesus Christ dying for them on the cross. That's the way.
That's the only way. And so that cup could not pass from him and he went along and yielded
himself and was obedient unto death even the death of the cross. And again, this is a great
picture of the Trinity as well because we see him saying to the Father not as I will but as
thou will. You know, what are these fools? These modulus or oneness idiots have to say about that.
Oh, you're saying that there's two different wills? You got it right because he said not my will.
Everybody counting? Not as I will but as thou will. Two wills there buddy because we got the father,
the son and Holy Ghost, three persons, one God, not one person, three persons, one God. And so we
have Jesus praying to the Father and he's saying not as I will but as thou will. That's how he was
able to be obedient unto death even the death of the cross. You know obedience can't exist with
one person, okay? Obedience is one person obeying another. It's a son obeying the Father.
Jump down if you would diverse 42. The Bible says he went away again the second time and prayed
saying, Oh, my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it,
thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy and he left
them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words. So we're going to come
back to this later in the sermon but three different times he prays to the Father and says,
if it's possible, let this cup pass from me but he's yielding to the will of the Father. He's
obedient unto death even the death of the cross. But the reason I'm showing you this is just to
really drive in the fact that this is going to be some hard things that he's going to go through
on the cross and he's sorrowful even unto death. He's sweating. He's an agony. He's praying.
He's begging the Father if there's any way that he can bypass this but he's reiterating the fact
to the Father that he's willing to do it. If this is what it takes to save you and me. Amen.
Look at Matthew chapter 27 verse 26, let's see what Christ endured on the cross when he endured
the cross for us. Let's look at the events of his physical suffering. The Bible says in chapter 27
verse 26, then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scurge Jesus, he delivered him to be
crucified. Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall and gathered under
the whole band of soldiers and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe and when they had
platted a crown of thorns platted means braided a crown of thorns. They put it upon his head
and a read in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying,
hell king of the Jews. So the first thing we see is that according to verse number 26, he was
scourged. It says when he had scourged Jesus, what does it mean to be scourged? It means to be beaten
with a whip. Now the Bible tells us all the way back in Isaiah 53, which is probably the greatest
chapter in the entire Old Testament. In Isaiah chapter 53, it says that by his stripes, we are healed.
By his stripes, we are healed. Why is that? Because it's the blood of Jesus Christ that cleanses
us from all sin and what were those stripes? They were stripes of blood. He was beaten with a whip
to the point where it left a bloody stripe and when the prophet Isaiah is looking at that bloody
stripe, he says by his stripes were healed. Why? Because without the shedding of blood, there's no
remission. So it's the stripes of Christ that heal us. So Jesus was beaten with a whip to the point
where each stroke of the whip created a bloody stripe that was left behind. He was probably beaten
39 times because that was the custom in those days to whip someone just short of the legal limit
of 40. So he was beaten with stripes. He was scourged. Then after that, he was stripped of his
clothing. Now look, this is humiliating. How would you like to be in a group of soldiers in the whole
band of soldiers and they strip you down of your clothing, right? That's humiliating. That's degrading
to be stripped naked. Then they put on him a scarlet robe. Now this is something that a king would
wear. A lot of people think Jesus just wore a robe around. Jesus never wore a robe. The only time
you see Jesus in a robe is when he's stripped and they put one on him to make fun of him.
Now when he comes back, he's going to be wearing a kingly robe. Amen. But when he was on the
seroth, he walked around humble among men and was among the working class and a humble garb. But
they're making fun of him saying, well, you know, if you're a king, let's dress you up like a king.
So they strip him down and they put this scarlet robe or purple robe or this gorgeous robe
upon him. What you would picture a king wearing purple and dyed garments because back in those days,
purple and scarlet were colors that were pretty expensive because of the dye technology that they
used. They had to get rare plants or rare animals to get these colors. And so they put this
robe on him and they make fun of him. They bow down to him, make fun of him, calm the king of the
Jews. But then in verse 30, it says, and they spit upon him. I don't know if you've ever had
anybody spit in your face. But when somebody spits in your face, it really makes your blood
boil, right? I mean, it's, it's angry. It's pretty humiliating. It's pretty much one of the
most assaulting things you could do to someone is just spit right in their face. So here he is.
He's been beaten horribly. His back is bloody and he's got that scarlet robe on his back.
He's got that crown of thorns shoved into his brow and they're spitting in his face, just spit
flying out of their mouths into his face. Think about that. Humiliating, gross. The whole band of soldiers,
all these dirty men spitting in his face. The crown of thorns itself shoved into his brow,
causing more blood and harm. Now, I've been over there to that region of the world and you know what
it looks like, Arizona, all right? And I know Arizona man, everything is sharp. There are thorns
everywhere. Every tree, every plant, every cactus has very long sharp needles. So you could produce
a crown of thorns that would be pretty formidable in Arizona and it's the same stuff over there.
It's a lot of the same landscape, a lot of the same plant life over there. And so it says,
when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head in verse 29 and a read
in his right hand and they bow the knee before him and mocked him saying, hey,
King of the Jews and they spit upon him and took the read and smoked him on the head.
So think about this. They just put a stick in his hand as his royal scepter. So get the picture.
He's bloody. He's beaten. He's surrounded by soldiers making fun of him. He's got the crown of thorns,
shoved onto his brow. He's got to stick in his hand and they're bound down making fun of him,
spitting on him, laughing at him, ridiculing him. And then they just take the stick and just
slamming into his head, just beat him in the head with a stick. He's probably still wearing the
crown of thorns. I mean, they probably beat that thing into his head with a stick. So Jesus is
being beaten. He's being humiliated. He's being ridiculed. Then the Bible says in verse 31,
after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him and put his own Raymond on him
and led him away to crucify him. You know, I imagine that when you're switching clothes
and your back has been beaten, that's going to hurt because as soon as you put on that robe,
what's going to happen? All that blood gets into that clothing. And I don't know if you've ever had
a bandage or clothing, get saturated with blood and it dries and then you rip it off. It's pretty
much just going to reopen all those wounds, right? So then they rip that robe off of him,
reopen all those wounds and then put his own clothing back on him and lead him away to crucify him.
It says in verse 32, and as they came out, they found a man of Cyrenee, Simon by name,
him they compelled to bear his cross. Now, from the other gospels, we know that there was a time
when Jesus carried his own cross. But then at this point, we see that someone else has to carry a form,
probably just because of the fact that he was physically unable to do it at this point. I mean,
if you think about it, he's probably carrying it, but he's been so beaten and so whipped and hid
in the head and the crown of thorns and everything like that, that he probably needed someone
to help him carry the thing. So they get this other man, Simon of Cyrenee to carry the cross for him.
It says in verse 33, when they were coming to a place called Golgotha, that is to say,
a place of a skull, they gave him vinegar to drink, mixed with gall. And when he had tasted
he would not drink. I don't blame him, that doesn't sound like a very tasty beverage. Vinegar is not
exactly a thirst quencher, okay? I went hiking with a guy and he had water with apple cider vinegar in
it as a beverage. That's too radical for me. I don't care how healthy that is. Give me Gatorade or
something, right? But they give him just the nastiest possible drink you can imagine, right?
They're giving him vinegar mixed with gall. This is everything that's just bitter and nasty and
sour and rotten tasting. So here he is, he's thirsty, he's exerted himself to the point where he's
probably collapsed under the way of the cross and they had to get Simon of Cyrenee to carry it for him.
He's beaten, he's mocked, he's ridiculed and then he's given vinegar and gall to drink
as his beverage. Then it says in verse number 35 they crucified him and parted his garments casting
lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet. They parted my garments among them
and upon my vesture did they cast lots. And then look at verse 36, I'm always kind of intrigued
by the short verses in the Bible. When there's just a little short verse like this and sitting down,
they watched him there and sitting down, they watched him there. So what is that? He's a spectacle.
He's basically this is entertainment for people. It's people just sitting down and just enjoying
the show. What wickedness? Who would enjoy such a spectacle? He didn't do anything wrong. This
isn't some violent criminal. He wasn't even accused of being a murderer or being a rapist or a
pedophile. I mean he's not being accused of those things. What's he being accused of? Oh this man
spoke against our religion, right? I mean think about that's all they're even accusing him of
is blasphemy. When he of course did not commit any blasphemy, everything he said was right and pure
and God's word but they sat down and they watched him there. He's a gazing stock, a laughing
stock, an entertainment, a spectacle unto them as they sit down and watch him there. Then the
Bible says in verse number 37 they set up over his head his accusation. You know people are probably
thinking, man maybe some people showed up and they don't know what did this guy do. This guy must
have done something horrible. Look at the way they're treating him. He's spat upon beaten, bloody
bruise. Everybody's sitting down and watching and enjoying the show and they set up the accusation.
This is Jesus the King of the Jews. That's the accusation that's written. Then there were two
thieves crucified with them. One on the right hand and another on the left and they that passed by
reviled and wagging their heads. I mean people are just shaking their head just totally disgusted
with the Lord Jesus Christ. Just shaking their head at how wicked they think he is or how bad they
think that he is or just total hatred and disgust for the Son of God. It says in verse 40 and saying
thou the destroyest, the temple and buildest it in three days. Save thyself. If thou be the Son
of God, come down from the cross. Likewise also the chief priest mocking him with the scribes and
elders said he saved others himself. He cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come
from the cross and we will believe in him. Now some people would say, you know, Jesus Christ is
not affected by this. It doesn't bother him, but that's not what the Bible says because the Bible
says that he despised the shame. It says he endured the cross despising the shame. You know what?
He did not want to go through this. He did not enjoy being mocked. He did not enjoy being made fun
He was not just passively or just neutrally just saying, oh, go ahead, spit in my face, hit me in the
head, make fun of me, laugh at me, ridicule. Look, I don't like being laughed at, ridiculed, mocked,
made fun of. I don't want to have the crown of thorns on my, I don't think anybody would want to go
through this. And Jesus endured this and he endured it because he so loved the world that he went
through this. He sacrificed his life. He laid down his life for us. He said, greater love,
have no man than this than that a man laid down his life for his friends. This was not easy. This
is not a cake walk for him. This is something that he agonized over and dreaded and endured this
suffering. Then the Bible says as they continued to mock him in verse 43, he trusted in God,
let him deliver him now if he will have him. For he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also
which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth. Now from the sixth hour, there was
darkness over all the land under the ninth hour and about the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud
voice saying, hey, Lee, hey, Lee, La Maa, somebody, he cries out with a loud voice. That is to say,
my God, my God, why has self forsaken me? Now why did Jesus Christ cry out? My God, my God,
why is self forsaken me? Well, first of all, the Bible says there's darkness over all the land.
So get the picture, okay? Jesus Christ is hanging on the cross. He's beaten. He's bloody. He's
bruised. His visage is more marred than the sons of man. He doesn't even look quite human. He's
so beaten and swollen and bloody and bruised. And as he hangs on the cross, there's darkness.
Some kind of an eclipse of some kind where there's just darkness. Even in the daytime, it just
becomes dark. Imagine it's just daylight. He's hanging on the cross and it just gets totally dark.
And at Christ's darkest hour, I mean, when he's gone through the most pain, the most suffering,
the most mockery, the most ridicule. It's all culminated in this. And he's hanging on the cross.
And then it's just darkness. He cries out and says, my God, my God, why has self forsaken me?
Now this is a very profound utterance on the cross. This is very important.
You know, Jesus Christ made seven utterances from the cross. There are seven things that the
Bible records. Jesus sang from the cross, but in order to get all seven of them, you have to
read all four gospels. This is the only one that's repeated because this one's in Matthew and Mark.
But not only is it repeated in Matthew and Mark, he gives it to us in the actual original
language of what Jesus actually said. And then he repeats it by giving us the translation.
So the things that Jesus said on the cross, most of them are recorded once. This one's recorded
four times, right? Because it's given to us in the original Aramaic and then in English. And then
we go to the book of Mark. And there it is in Aramaic and English once again. This is a quadruple
mention. This is something very important. Okay. This is part of the suffering that Christ endured on
the cross is being forsaken of the Father. Now again, this is something that people will try to
whitewash or sugarcoat or or try to explain this away or twist this. Look, let's just believe what
the Bible says. If God emphasizes something four times, it's pretty important. Wouldn't you agree with
that? I mean, everything Christ said on the cross was important. We hear a lot about it is finished.
I mean, I've heard a lot of sermons on it is finished, right? Okay, this is recorded four times.
This is an important statement that Jesus Christ made on the cross. And so we don't want to
allow people to twist this or water this down. Let's just stop and look at these words. My God,
my God, why I stopped forsaken me? He didn't say, did you forsake me? He said, why
hasst thou forsaken me? Now, if Jesus Christ was not forsaken by God, the Father, then this
will be a false accusation. You know, if I said, you know, why have you forsaken me and God didn't
forsake me, then that wouldn't even make any sense, right? Jesus Christ, he knew all things,
he's perfect. Everything he says is perfect. He's not just going to make some
spurious claim here, just some utterance that's wrong and then, oh, let's record that four times
in the New Testament. What he's saying here is right, he was forsaken here. Okay, why is that? Because
of the fact that the Bible says in Habakkuk that the Lord is a pure eyes then to behold the evil and
can't not look on an equity. I mean, God is so holy that when Jesus Christ actually took upon him
the sins of the world, the Bible says he who knew knows sin became sin for us that we might be made
the righteousness of God. And so when Jesus Christ is on the cross, the Bible says who is
own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree. So when Jesus Christ on the cross,
he who knew knows sin became sin for us. That's why the picture of Jesus on the cross was a serpent
on a pole. Why would a serpent represent Jesus? But the Bible said in John chapter three,
as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so much the Son of Man be lifted up,
that whosoever believe it than him should not perish, but have eternal life. Why would Jesus
Christ be represented by a serpent? A serpent is everything this wicked because he who knew knows sin
became sin for us. He took upon him the sins of the world. He who knew knows sin. He who was perfect,
blameless, the spotless lamb of God. He was tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin.
He took upon him the iniquity and the Bible says the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all.
And so all the rotten sins of every human being who's ever lived, an unimaginable amount of sin.
I mean, we each have our own huge laundry list of sin of all the thousands of sins that we've
committed in our lifetime. Now take all the sins of all the billions of people of the whole world.
I mean, it's just an unbelievable amount of sin that was placed on Jesus Christ. And you know what?
No longer is there the sweet communion between father and son. No longer is Jesus Christ that beloved
son and whom he's so well pleased, who does always those things which please him. Now all the
of a sudden he has taken upon him the sins of the world. Now all of a sudden he who knew knows sin
became sin for us. And so now God the Father's relationship to the Son becomes one of judgment and wrath.
Now God the Father is bruising the Son. Now God the Father is punishing the Son for the sins of
the whole world. Think about that change. Think about having sweet communion and fellowship
with your Father and then getting to the place where your Father is judging you for the worst possible
crimes. I mean, whatever the worst possible crimes add them all together. That's what Jesus is being
punished for. So God the Father is now his judge. You know, God the Father is now taking out the
punishment on him. I mean, that's pretty profound. That's pretty important. You see why this is an
important statement. That's why I said my God, my God, why I sell forsaken me. So here's how
people try to twist this. I've heard a few different things about this. Some people said, well
he's just quoting Psalm 22. He's just quoting scripture. Or I've even heard some people take it
even so far as say, well, he's singing a song. You're not going to sing songs when you're beaten
within an inch of your life hanging on the cross and being condemned for the sins of the whole world.
You're not just going to burst into song. Okay. I hear, I mean, there's some dumb doctrine out there.
Somebody said, oh, he's singing because he wanted them to sing along. So he gives them the first
expecting them to pick up the rest. It's nonsense. Okay. But I'm going to prove to you right now
by the way, Jesus is not even quoting Psalm 22 right here. Okay. Because here's what they say,
oh, he's just quoting scripture. He's a, and these are the same people that, oh, in the Garden of
I guess somebody, he didn't really mean that when he said, you know, not his eye will, but his
eye will, he's just sending an example of prayer. No, he meant that. Jesus didn't just go through the
motions. You know, just pretending to kind of go through life and being tempted in all points
like as we are. No, no, no, he went through those things. He really was hungry, thirsty, angry, sad.
He really did get tired and go through the struggles and trials and tribulations that we go through.
He went through all that. We have not had high priests which cannot be touched with the feeling of
our infirmities. He was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin. So Jesus Christ
wasn't just going through the motions here and just pretending to pray in the Garden just to kind
of show us how to pray or he's on the cross. No, no, the Bible says he's screaming out at the top
of his lungs. My God, my God, why is thou forsaken me at his darkest hour in literal darkness?
He screams it out. Why? Because he's speaking to the Father crying out, saying, my God,
my God, why is thou forsaken me? It's coming from his heart. He's not quoting scripture.
I'm going to prove it to you. You say, well, he's just quoting Psalm 22. Flip over if you
would have Psalm 22 verse 1. Psalm 22 verse 1. Keep your finger in Matthew. We'll be back there.
Psalm 22 verse 1. And this is where we find the exact same words. My God, my God, why is thou forsaken
me? Psalm 22 verse 1 says, my God, my God, why is thou forsaken me? Why are thou so far from helping me
and from the words of my roaring? And you say, well, see right there. He's clearly quoting
Psalm 22. Wrong. He is not quoting Psalm 22. And I'm going to prove it to you. Here's why.
Because there's a reason why God gave it to us in the original language. I mean, how often does
God tell us what Jesus said in the original language? Very rarely. Usually he just gives it to us
in our language, right? We're reading our King James Bible and we're just going to get it in English.
Or if we were reading a Greek New Testament, we're just getting it in Greek, right? Because that's
what the people understand. That's what we understand. But yet, if I'm reading a Greek New Testament,
I get it in the original language. If I'm reading a King James Bible, I get this original language.
Elie, elie, llama, sabach, tani, why did he give us that? Just for fun. Just say, let me just give
you a little original language here. Just spice up your reading a little. No, there's a reason why.
I'll tell you the reason why because it's not Hebrew. Okay. The reason he tells us that he
said, elie, elie, llama, sabach, tani, so that, well, no, it's not Hebrew. That is not Hebrew. That is
Aramaic. It's a different language. Okay. So God's trying to show us something here. Let me illustrate
to you what he's trying to show us by giving us this original language and showing us this is
Hebrew. This is Aramaic. Okay. So let me get a couple of volunteers. Let's get my, my guys from
Fresno up here. All right. Let's get these guys up here. So let's have you stand over here. Okay.
And let's have you stand over here. Okay. Now, this right here is going to illustrate David. Okay.
David is the one who gave us the Psalm Psalm 22. Right. And so David was the psalmist of Israel
that God inspired the Holy Ghost spake through David to give us this psalm Psalm 22. Right. Okay.
Now, this guy's living around 1000 BC. So this is about 1000 years before Christ roughly. Okay.
And then over here, he's going to represent Jesus. Okay. Jesus on the cross and then all these people
here. Right. These are the people that are watching Jesus on the cross that are observing
Jesus on the cross that are with Jesus at this time. Okay. And then all the people over here
are going to represent David's audience. Okay. So these are the people they're living in 1000 BC.
Right. They're living in Jerusalem. They're living in Israel. They're living in wherever in a
1000 BC ancient kingdom of Israel. This is their king. This is King David. Right. Okay. And then
over here, who's this? This is Jesus. He's on the cross. Right. And these are all the people in Judea
or, or just whoever that's there observing on the cross. Somebody understand? Okay. So the question
is what language does this guy speak? This guy speaks Hebrew. Right. This is the heyday of biblical
Hebrew 1000 BC book of Psalms written in the Hebrew language by David and others 1000 BC. They're
speaking Hebrew. Okay. Now what language does this guy speak? This guy speaks Aramaic. Okay. And
all throughout the Bible, in fact, when you see Jesus, and it tells you exactly what he said, like
where it says, Talita, Kumi, or when it says, Ephathah, who knows what I'm talking about, where you get
those little statements where it'll say, here's what he said, and it's interpreted as, and then it
tells you the interpretation. Those, those words are all Aramaic. So that's how, that's one of the
reasons why we know Jesus spoke Aramaic. He's not speaking the biblical Hebrew of 1000 BC. He's actually
speaking Aramaic. Okay. That's the language of the day. That's the most popular language. There's also
obviously Hebrew in the synagogue and Greek is a big language as well. And when Jesus went to the synagogue,
yeah, they're rolling out the scroll and they're reading the Bible in Hebrew. But what you have to
understand about these two languages, okay, this guy's language of Hebrew, and this guy's language of
Aramaic is that they're related, okay. They're related, like, say, for example, Spanish and French.
Now, Spanish and French are pretty closely related, aren't they? Or we could say Spanish and Italian,
okay. They're pretty closely related, and you'll see a lot of similarities and a lot of words
will even be exactly the same or things will be the same. But then other things are very different.
Other things are closely related, okay. But these languages are pretty similar languages,
but they're not the same language. They're different, okay. So stop and think about this, okay.
This guy over here, what is he saying in 33 AD? He's saying,
Okay. This guy over here, what is he saying, okay. He's not saying
ALI, ALI, llama sabachteni, because if you look it up in a Hebrew Bible, that's not what it says.
It actually says ALI, ALI, llama azatani. It's a different word. Azatani, it's a different word,
because it's Hebrew, biblical Hebrew is what this guy's speaking. This guy's speaking a different
language, Aramaic. Now, part of it's the same, the ALI, ALI, llama, because they're very closely
related languages, like Spanish and French, or Spanish and Italian are going to have a lot of
words in common. But it's not the same, right? Because this guy's saying Azatani, and this guy's
saying sabachteni, and it's two totally different words in two different languages. Everybody
understanding? Now, stop and think about this. If this guy is quoting this guy, okay. Isn't that
what they're saying? Oh, Jesus, when he's on the cross, he's just quoting Psalm 22. Well, look,
has this guy read a Hebrew Bible before? Yeah, didn't he go in the synagogue every week and pull
out the Bible and read it? So did this guy read out of a Hebrew Bible? Does this guy know how to speak
Hebrew? Yeah, he did know how to speak Hebrew, because there are other times when he spoke in Hebrew,
where it tells us he said it in Hebrew, or when he's reading in the synagogue and rolling out the
scroll of Isaiah as his custom was on a weekly basis, this guy knows how to read the Bible in Hebrew.
Does everybody understand? But what's his everyday language? His main language is Aramaic. See,
that's his heart language. You see, people who speak multiple languages, one language is the one
that's closest to their heart. So if they get in an emergency situation, they're not going to speak
a foreign language, right? I mean, think about it. Like, let's say I'm just speaking German all the time
and I'm in Germany and I'm speaking German, but I'm an English speaker at heart. Well, let's say I
hurt myself really bad and cry out to God. Let's say I chop a finger off and I'm just crying out,
oh, God, please help me. I'm not going to do that in German, right? What am I going to do that
in? I'm going to do it in English, because that's my heart language. So Jesus here on the cross is
speaking his main language, his heart language, his primary language, he cries out to the father,
my God, my God, why is that forsaken me in his heart language? Now, if he were quoting Scripture,
he'd quote Scripture, right? I think about this. Let's say that you felt like you were forsaken by God.
Okay. Would you do it in a King James English? If you were going through your darkest hour,
if you have nails through your hands and nails through your feet and you're hanging on the cross,
you're beaten, you're dying, and now God's wrath is on you. Are you going to cry out and start
quoting Scripture in King, in the King's English? Wherefore, how's thou done this one to be, Lord?
You're going to be like, why are you doing this to me? What's going on? Right? Does everybody
understand the difference between your heart language? Now, look, if I need to speak King James
English, I can do it. If I need to speak German, I can do it. If I need to speak Spanish, I can do
it. But you know, if I'm in a jam, calling out to the Lord, it's going to be in English. It's
going to be in my heart language. It's going to be in my own vernacular. So here he is on the cross
crying out in his heart language. Why? Because he's in his most dark, bleak, miserable
hour crying out from the heart to the Father. Not quoting Scripture, because if he wanted to quote
Scripture, then he would have quoted it right. He would have quoted it in the language of Scripture.
Instead, he quotes it in his heart language. Now, let's stop. So this doesn't make any sense to say
that he's quoting him. Because if he's quoting him, then he would have said, la má, la má,
or I'm sorry, a lí, a lí, la má, a zabtane. Right? He would have done the Hebrew, a zabtane.
He wouldn't have said it in Aramaic. But now let's say this guy's quoting this guy.
Let's say that David in a thousand BC is looking forward to the cross, being a prophet,
being a seer, foreseeing that Christ would die on the cross. And he's prophesying about Christ
on the cross, right? And he foresees the future. The this guy's going to say, my God, my God,
why is thou forsaken me? And he wants to deliver that truth to these people who speak what language?
Okay. And he wants to deliver it as a song for them to sing in what language?
Why? Because guess what? At this time, they don't speak Aramaic.
Because they picked up Aramaic and the Babylonian captivity hundreds and hundreds of years later.
So at this time, Aramaic's not even a thing. In a thousand BC, when Psalms is being written,
when King David's on the throne, Aramaic is not a thing in Israel. It's only Hebrew. It's all about
the Hebrew language. So if he's going to give it to them in their language, he's going to give it
to them in Hebrew. Does everybody understand? So he's taking what Jesus said in Aramaic,
and he's given it to the people in Hebrew because that's what they speak. Does everybody understand?
So guess what? That proves that this guy is quoting this guy and not that this guy is quoting
this guy. Does everybody see the difference? Because if this guy is quoting this guy, he would have
done it in Hebrew. Whereas if this guy is quoting this guy, he can't do it in Aramaic,
it's not a round in that geography at that time. So he's going to do it in Hebrew. Go ahead and have a
a seat. And look, you say, well, you're splitting hairs, or you're going to deep, or you're getting
too complicated. Well, you know what? Why did God even put that in the Bible then? Why didn't he even
spell it out? Ali, Ali, Llamas, Abhaktani in both places, Mark and Matthew, when we can flip
open Hebrew Bible and see that it says something different. It says, Ali, Ali, Llama, Azabtani,
which is a totally different word because it's Hebrew versus Aramaic. Why is that so important
is because it shows the power of prophecy is looking forward to the cross quoting Jesus.
So Jesus is not quoting Psalm 22. Psalm 22 is quoting Jesus.
And when we see Isaiah 53, it's looking forward to the cross. Psalm 22 is looking forward to the
cross. When it says, they pierced my hands and my feet, that's Jesus talking. So it's just so
dumb to say, oh, Jesus quoting scripture, no scriptures quoting Jesus. Why? Because Jesus Christ,
the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. And guess what? David the prophet, he looked
forward to the cross of Christ. Isaiah the prophet looked forward to the cross of Christ.
Every saved person in the Old Testament looked forward to the cross of Jesus Christ.
So don't try to water this down and say, well, you know, he's just quoting a verse.
He wasn't just doing a little scripture memory up there. He's up there at his darkest
moment, screaming out to God. But you know, this goes against a lot of this oneness Pentecostal
modalist because they don't, they believe that God is one person. They don't believe in the
Trinity, the father, son, and Holy Ghost. So this verse makes no sense without the Trinity.
Because if you believe that God's this one person, was he forsaking himself?
He can't forsake himself, right? No, it's the father forsaking the son is what happened. And
you know what that proves that there's a father and a son and it proves that the father is not the
son. And the son is not the father because one is forsaking the other. And you know, a lot of
these oneness Pentecostals and modulus, what they'll do then is they'll say, well, it's God forsaking
the man Jesus. Well, who's this? The man Jesus because the Jesus is God. You know, the man Jesus
is divine. The human being, the man Jesus Christ is deity. He's God. Jesus is God. He's always been God.
He always will be God. He's divine. But God exists as three persons, father, son and Holy Ghost.
Now, if you're Muslim, you're going to have a problem with that. You're going to say God's one person.
You know, if you're a, if you're a Sikh, you're going to say God is one. God's one person, right?
If you're any other fault, if you're Jewish, you're going to say God's only one person.
But you know, if you're a Christian, you're going to say God's three persons. The father of the
son and the Holy Ghost. See, if you notice that our God is totally different than all the gods of
the heathen, their oneness God is not the God of the Bible. The God of the Bible said, let us make
man an our image after our likeness because he internally exists as father, son and Holy Ghost.
Very important. And so we see that nothing in the Bible is incidental, coincidental, or accidental.
Everything is there for a reason. And when God gives us these words that that are just gibberish
unto us, you know, for unlearn it, and we say, a Lee, a Lee, what is that? There's a reason, huh?
Why? Because you can do what? You can figure out number one, Jesus being Aramaic.
Put that in your Hebrew rights or Hebrew roots pipe and smoke it. Because think about the Hebrew
roots, they act like, oh, Hebrews, the special magical wonderful language. It's funny because our
Savior walked around speaking a different language. There's nothing special about that language.
God can speak to us today in English, just as well as he did in Hebrew. He can speak to us
today in English, just as well as he did in Greek. He can speak to us in English, just as well as
he did Aramaic. He can speak to us in Spanish, just as well as he does in English. He can speak to
us in all tongues. The Holy Ghost can speak any language. And so God is not limited to Hebrew as a
mystical language, no wrong. Hebrew is just like any other language. A language is a language is a
language. And you know what? God's the one who split up the languages of the Tower of Babel and he
wants all of us to know him. And we can all know him in the tongue. We're in, we're born. We don't
have to learn a foreign language today. You know, who here only speaks English, that's all you speak.
Hey, guess what? You can know everything you need to know about God with that one language. You
have everything that pertains to life and godliness right here in this book. You can go to the
grave being an only English speaker. And you can have all the right doctrine from this book right
the King James Bible. You don't have to learn Hebrew in order to understand the Bible. Okay.
The only Hebrew you need is the couple little words that he gives you where he tells you a
couple words and tells you what they mean, right? You know, he'll say, hey, the King of Salem,
that's the King of peace. You know, he'll break things down for you like that in the Bible.
But you don't need to learn a foreign language today to know God. You can know God in English or
Spanish or whatever your language is. Now let's go back to Hebrews chapter 12 now.
So we've specifically seen what Christ endured on the cross. I've lost some of my notes here. I'll
hear there. We've seen specifically what Christ endured on the cross. Let me just give you a quick
review. He was scourged. He was stripped. He was put in a scarlet robe as a mockery. He was
plated a crown of thorns and shoved it on his head. He was mocked. He was spat upon. He was
smitten on the head with a stick. They ripped off his robe off of his bloody back and put his own
clothing on him. His cross had to be carried by someone else, which is humiliating that he can't
carry his own cross. Somebody else had to carry it for him. He was given vinegar mingled with
gall to drink. Then later, I didn't get there for sake of time. Later, he's given vinegar to drink
the second time. In the book of Matthew alone, it records twice that they're giving him vinegar
to drink. He was made a spectacle and a mockery. They sat down and watched him there. He was
reviled and, worst of all, he was forsaken by God, the Father. Why? Because God, the Father,
he couldn't look on the sand. He couldn't look on the iniquity. He had to basically now change
that relationship from a sweet, loving Father, some relationship to being the judge and punishing
Jesus for our sins, bruising him for our iniquities, laying on him the iniquity of us all.
He went through some horrible things on the cross, didn't he? Because of his love for us,
he endured those things and suffered on the cross for us.
Now, Hebrews chapter 12 with all that in mind. Look what the Bible says in verse 1,
we're foreseen, we also are encompassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses. Let us lay aside
every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience, the race that
is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that
was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the
throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself,
lest ye be worried and faint in your mind. What's he telling us? And he says, you've not
ever resisted under blood striving against sin. What's he telling us here? He's saying, look,
we need to look to the cross of Jesus today. And what does that mean when we say look to the
cross of Jesus? That means that when we're going through struggles, when we're going through
trials, when things are going bad, you know what we need to think about? We need to think about the
fact that Christ was beaten and that he was stripped down of his clothing, that he was mocked,
that he was spat upon. Because you know what? There are going to be times when you go through
financial problems. Or there are going to be times where you get physical sickness or physical
injury. There are going to be times when you're laid up in the hospital. There are going to be
times when you are spat upon. There are going to be times when people tell you horrible things
or that they hate you or that they're disgusted with you. People that you love will turn on you.
But you know what? You're never going to go through anything worse than what Jesus went through.
Oh, you might be spat upon, but you're not going to be spat upon and stripped naked and
crowned with thorns and hitting the head with a stick and whip 39 times, right? And have God the
Father just turn on you. You know what? That's never going to happen because He'll never leave
us or forsake us. We're never going to go through that aspect. I'm never going to have to know
what that feels like where you cry out from the depths of your soul. My God, my God, why is that
forsaken me? Because He'll never leave me nor forsake me. But Jesus was forsaken. Jesus was forsaken
so that we'll never be forsaken. Amen. And you know what? No matter what you're going through,
you're never going to go through more than what He went through. Never. I don't care what you're
going through. It'll never add up to that. And then He says to consider Him that endured such
contradiction of sinners against Himself, lest you be weary and faint in your minds. You know,
you might get the part where you just say, you know what? I've had it. I'm tired. I'm worn out. I'm
sick of fighting. It's such a struggle all the time. It's just a struggle to go to church. It's
a struggle to stay out soul winning. It's a struggle to be faithful. It's a struggle to take a
stand. Everybody's telling me I should quit. My family thinks I'm crazy. You know, nobody supports
me on this. You know, I'm just throwing in the towel. I, you know, I tried, but it's just too hard
living the Christian life. It's just too hard going to fade forward, Baptist Church. It's just too
hard living this Christian life of soul winning and zeal for the Lord. It's just too much. I quit.
I give up. And you know, we've all felt that way. Just like, I've had it. I'm done. But you know what?
That's when we need to look at Jesus. When we get to that point where you're broken down and you're
ready to quit and you've had it and you're sick of it and everybody's giving you a bad time. Your
friends have turned on you. Family's not supporting you. The bank accounts and the negative
and everybody's just got it in for you or maybe you're sick. You're injured. You're in physical
pain. You're bleeding. You're in the hospital broken and suffering. You know what? That's when you need
to open your Bible and read Matthew chapter 27. And that's when you need to get in your mind's eye.
Jesus Christ beaten bloody hanging on the cross. And you know what he's saying? He's saying,
this is my body, which is broken for you. This is my body, which is given for you. This cup is the
New Testament in my blood. And picture Jesus Christ broken bleeding dying on the cross saying,
father forgive them for they know not what they do. And realize that as he said, he could call
legions of angels. But how then would the scripture be fulfilled? How then would he drink the cup
that the father had given him? How then could he get you saved and get you to heaven? We know
what we need to get other people saved. And you know what the Bible says? If any man will come after
me, let him deny himself and do what? Take up his cross and follow me. So we look to Jesus and
then you know what we do when we look to Jesus, we pick up our cross. And say, you know what? If
Jesus did that, if Jesus endured that, if Jesus suffered through that, you know what? I can go through
some suffering. I could keep fighting. I could suffer. I could keep going. I'm not going to faint
in my mind. I'm not going to be weary and well doing. I'm going to keep on going. I'm going to be
steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord because I know that my labor is not
in vain. And just as Jesus for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, we can endure
our cross for the joy that is set before us. Say, well, he's doing it to save mankind. You know what? But
we're doing it to save some. We're doing it to save some. He needed to save all mankind. But our
suffering is not as great as it is. And we're doing it for people to be saved. We're doing it to
reach people. What did Paul say? He said, I endure all things for the elects sake that they may also
obtain the salvation, which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. Now one last place I want to go
to is 2 Corinthians, chapter 12. 2 Corinthians, chapter 12. Do you remember how when Jesus was in the
Garden of Eden? I keep on to say Garden of Eden. Garden of Gethsemane, you remember how Jesus was in
the Garden of Eden, too, by the way. He's walking with Adam in the cool of the day, right? Yeah,
Jesus was in the Garden of Eden forming man with his own hands and forming him from the ground
of the earth and breathing into his nostrils the breath of life. Don't tell me Jesus didn't exist
in the Old Testament. Don't tell me Jesus was not a man in the Old Testament or that he wasn't the
Son of God in the Old Testament. No, he walked in that garden and he physically formed
man from the dust of the ground with his own hands. But that was just because I misspoke and said
Eden. I meant to say the Garden of Gethsemane, hey, when Jesus was in the Garden of Gethsemane and
he prayed, how many times did he ask for the cup to be removed from him? Does everybody remember?
Three times, right? He went and he prayed and asked the Father to deliver him. If there's any other
way, let the cup pass from him, but not his eye will, but his eye will, then he goes and checks
on the disciples. He prays a second time. He goes and checks on the disciples and a third time.
Now, the first two times it gives us exactly what he said. The third time it said he prayed the
same words. So that tells us that three times we know for sure that he asked the Lord if it's
possible remove this cup from me. Okay, everybody got that? Now let's look at what the Apostle Paul
said in 2 Corinthians chapter 12. The Bible says in verse number seven, and lest I should be exalted
above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.
The messenger of Satan to buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing,
I besought the Lord the rice that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, my grace is sufficient
for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my
infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities
and reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distress as for Christ's sake for when I am weak
then am I strong. What's he saying? He said three times, I asked the Lord for this cup to pass from me.
Three times, I asked that the thorn in my flesh would be removed. Three times, I asked that the
messenger of Satan that's buffeting me, what does buffet me beating me up, will be removed? Well,
you know what? Jesus asked three times, not to be buffeted. Jesus asked three times that the thorn
in his flesh wouldn't be there. Did he have a thorn in his flesh? You better know he did,
the crown of thorns. Three times, he didn't want to be buffeted. Three times, he didn't want to be
suffering and going through the thorns and the punishments and the messengers of Satan buffeting
him. But you know what? The Lord said, my grace is sufficient for thee, my strength is made
perfect in weakness. He said, you know what? I'll gladly go through whatever cross God has for me
to carry that the power of Christ might rest upon me. You know what we're seeing here is we're
seeing that the Apostle Paul had his own cross to bear. Just as Jesus had his cross to bear,
just as Jesus had the cup that he had to drink, you know what? We all have the cup that we have
to drink. And it's different for everybody. We all have the thorn that we have to endure. Are you
going to endure it? He endured the cross. Will you endure your cross? Will you pick up your cross
and fall in Christ? Or do you want the easy life? Or do you want your best life now? Or do you
want the easy Christianity down at the comfortable church where everybody makes you feel good
and good devil, good sin, cold hell type of a church. It's out there. Or do you want to go to
take up your cross Baptist church? Thorne in the flesh Baptist church, sufferings of Christ Baptist
church. Hey, gladly. Paul said, all endure it gladly. Hey, I'll ask the Lord three times. Why?
Jesus has the Lord three times. But you know what? He had to go through it. What about the disciples
what they said? You know, hey, we want to sit in your right hand and I'm glad Jesus. He said,
are you ready to drink of the cup that I drink? And you know what he said? You know what?
Barely you will drink of the cup that I drink. Take up your cross and follow me. And it's no
different today in 2018. If you follow Christ, there's going to be suffering. There's going to be
a cross to be. Now, it's not going to be a bad is what Jesus went through. You'll never go beyond what
he would either. But when you find yourself in that dark out, don't quit and don't go running down to
the sissy church down the street. We're a little sissy Baptist. We're wearing everything
soft and smooth and comfortable and trendy. And I don't know, you know what? Look at the Jesus,
the author and finish your work. Hey, keep going. All right. Take up the cross and follow me.
As far as I'm working. A lot of me thank you so much for your word. Thank you so much for sending
the son to be the savior of the world. Lord, we thank you so much for the supreme sacrifice
of our Lord Jesus Christ. His dad, his burial, his resurrection, his stripes that heal us. Lord, help us.
Take up that cross and never put it down, Lord. And when we're tempted to quit and when we
be big, we would be in a vein in our minds. Help us to look onto Jesus. The author and finish

[55:54.560 --> 56:00.640]  Three times, right? He went and he prayed and asked the Father to deliver him. If there's any other
[56:00.960 --> 56:04.800]  way, let the cup pass from him, but not his eye will, but his eye will, then he goes and checks
[56:04.800 --> 56:10.480]  on the disciples. He prays a second time. He goes and checks on the disciples and a third time.
[56:10.480 --> 56:16.400]  Now, the first two times it gives us exactly what he said. The third time it said he prayed the
[56:16.400 --> 56:24.320]  same words. So that tells us that three times we know for sure that he asked the Lord if it's
[56:24.320 --> 56:30.400]  possible remove this cup from me. Okay, everybody got that? Now let's look at what the Apostle Paul
[56:30.960 --> 56:36.800]  said in 2 Corinthians chapter 12. The Bible says in verse number seven, and lest I should be exalted
[56:36.800 --> 56:41.440]  above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh.
[56:42.160 --> 56:48.880]  The messenger of Satan to buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing,
[56:48.880 --> 56:58.400]  I besought the Lord the rice that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, my grace is sufficient
[56:59.120 --> 57:06.240]  for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my
[57:06.240 --> 57:13.760]  infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities
[57:13.760 --> 57:20.480]  and reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distress as for Christ's sake for when I am weak
[57:20.480 --> 57:26.880]  then am I strong. What's he saying? He said three times, I asked the Lord for this cup to pass from me.
[57:27.680 --> 57:34.000]  Three times, I asked that the thorn in my flesh would be removed. Three times, I asked that the
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.880]  messenger of Satan that's buffeting me, what does buffet me beating me up, will be removed? Well,
[57:38.880 --> 57:45.440]  you know what? Jesus asked three times, not to be buffeted. Jesus asked three times that the thorn
[57:45.440 --> 57:51.520]  in his flesh wouldn't be there. Did he have a thorn in his flesh? You better know he did,
[57:51.600 --> 57:58.080]  the crown of thorns. Three times, he didn't want to be buffeted. Three times, he didn't want to be
[57:58.080 --> 58:04.000]  suffering and going through the thorns and the punishments and the messengers of Satan buffeting
[58:04.000 --> 58:10.720]  him. But you know what? The Lord said, my grace is sufficient for thee, my strength is made
[58:10.720 --> 58:17.440]  perfect in weakness. He said, you know what? I'll gladly go through whatever cross God has for me
[58:17.440 --> 58:22.080]  to carry that the power of Christ might rest upon me. You know what we're seeing here is we're
[58:22.080 --> 58:28.160]  seeing that the Apostle Paul had his own cross to bear. Just as Jesus had his cross to bear,
[58:28.160 --> 58:33.200]  just as Jesus had the cup that he had to drink, you know what? We all have the cup that we have
[58:33.200 --> 58:39.040]  to drink. And it's different for everybody. We all have the thorn that we have to endure. Are you
[58:39.040 --> 58:46.720]  going to endure it? He endured the cross. Will you endure your cross? Will you pick up your cross
[58:46.800 --> 58:53.040]  and fall in Christ? Or do you want the easy life? Or do you want your best life now? Or do you
[58:53.040 --> 59:00.560]  want the easy Christianity down at the comfortable church where everybody makes you feel good
[59:00.560 --> 59:08.800]  and good devil, good sin, cold hell type of a church. It's out there. Or do you want to go to
[59:08.800 --> 59:15.600]  take up your cross Baptist church? Thorne in the flesh Baptist church, sufferings of Christ Baptist
[59:15.600 --> 59:24.400]  church. Hey, gladly. Paul said, all endure it gladly. Hey, I'll ask the Lord three times. Why?
[59:24.400 --> 59:30.080]  Jesus has the Lord three times. But you know what? He had to go through it. What about the disciples
[59:30.080 --> 59:34.640]  what they said? You know, hey, we want to sit in your right hand and I'm glad Jesus. He said,
[59:34.640 --> 59:38.720]  are you ready to drink of the cup that I drink? And you know what he said? You know what?
[59:38.720 --> 59:46.640]  Barely you will drink of the cup that I drink. Take up your cross and follow me. And it's no
[59:46.640 --> 59:52.400]  different today in 2018. If you follow Christ, there's going to be suffering. There's going to be
[59:52.400 --> 59:58.000]  a cross to be. Now, it's not going to be a bad is what Jesus went through. You'll never go beyond what
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.480]  he would either. But when you find yourself in that dark out, don't quit and don't go running down to
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:10.800]  the sissy church down the street. We're a little sissy Baptist. We're wearing everything
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:16.560]  soft and smooth and comfortable and trendy. And I don't know, you know what? Look at the Jesus,
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.760]  the author and finish your work. Hey, keep going. All right. Take up the cross and follow me.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:28.480]  As far as I'm working. A lot of me thank you so much for your word. Thank you so much for sending
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:36.320]  the son to be the savior of the world. Lord, we thank you so much for the supreme sacrifice
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:42.480]  of our Lord Jesus Christ. His dad, his burial, his resurrection, his stripes that heal us. Lord, help us.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:50.880]  Take up that cross and never put it down, Lord. And when we're tempted to quit and when we
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:56.480]  be big, we would be in a vein in our minds. Help us to look onto Jesus. The author and finish
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:02.080]  your work, babe. Help us not be weary and well-doing Jesus named the great man.
